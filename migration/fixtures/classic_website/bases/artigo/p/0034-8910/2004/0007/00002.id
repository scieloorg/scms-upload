!v704!<br>   <B>METHODS: </B>The survey was carried out on professional workers in social    care. Some were shiftworkers whose schedule included night shifts (N=311), some    were shiftworkers without night shifts (N=207) and some were non-shiftworkers    (N=1,210). Surveys were mailed and the response rate was 86%. For the purpose    of this study several variables were selected from the Survey: The Quality of    Life Profile, which measures importance, satisfaction, control and opportunities    in nine domains of life plus measures of happiness, life satisfaction and demands    of work.    ^cY

!v704!<br>   <B>RESULTS: </B>While both groups of shiftworkers, compared to non-shiftworkers,    reported needing more physical effort to complete their work, and reported 'being'    more physically tired, no differences were found in reports of overall happiness,    life satisfaction or total quality of life. However, night-shiftworkers reported    greater percentage of time unhappy than the other two groups of workers. In    analyses of the quality of life, night-shiftworkers were less satisfied with    domains of spiritual 'being' and physical and community 'belonging' than day-shiftworkers    and non-shiftworkers. They also reported having fewer opportunities to improve    their physical 'being', leisure, and personal growth than the other two groups.    ^cY

!v704!<br>   <b>RESULTADOS: </b>Em compara&ccedil;&atilde;o    com os trabalhadores que n&atilde;o trabalham em turnos, ambos os grupos de    trabalhadores em turnos informaram precisar fazer um esfor&ccedil;o f&iacute;sico    maior para completar o trabalho e "sentir" um cansa&ccedil;o f&iacute;sico    maior. Entretanto, n&atilde;o foram encontradas diferen&ccedil;as nos relatos    de felicidade global, satisfa&ccedil;&atilde;o pessoal e qualidade global de    vida. Os trabalhadores de turnos noturnos relataram, no entanto, passar um maior    tempo infelizes em rela&ccedil;&atilde;o aos outros dois grupos de trabalhadores.    As an&aacute;lises de qualidade de vida revelaram que os trabalhadores de turnos    noturnos sentiam-se menos satisfeitos nos dom&iacute;nios de "ser"    espiritual e "pertin&ecirc;ncia" f&iacute;sica e comunit&aacute;ria    que os trabalhadores diurnos e os que n&atilde;o trabalhavam em turnos. Tamb&eacute;m    informaram ter menos oportunidades de aperfei&ccedil;oar o seu "ser"    f&iacute;sico, lazer e crescimento pessoal em compara&ccedil;&atilde;o com os    outros dois grupos.     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To better understand worker's well-being, it    is important to know about aspects of their lives besides work, such as social    and domestic life. There are different approaches to the concept and measurement    of quality of life. A single measure of happiness or life satisfaction could    describe in general how "life is good" for an individual. In this    study we used a multifaceted approach to quality of life assessment developed    by Renwick et al<SUP>16,17</SUP> (1994; 1996) who emphasized physical, physiological,    and spiritual functioning. According to these researchers quality of life (QOL)    can be defined as "the degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities    of his/her life" (p. 232.).<SUP>15</SUP> There may be specific domains    of QOL in which shiftworkers are particularly affected by their work schedule.    However, there are only few investigations dealing with these aspects. </font></p>     ^cY

Particularly, we were interested in the subjective well 'being'    of workers, i.e., overall happiness and life satisfaction. Additionally, we    examined the relationship between different work schedules and workers' estimates    of physical, mental and social demands that work settings puts on them. Also,    we examined differences in quality of life of nine specific subdomains between    groups of workers, as well as the estimates of control and opportunities to    enhance each of subdomain. In general, we predicted that work including night    shifts would be associated with poorer quality of life. We were also interested    in which of the domains quality, control and opportunities were better or worse    within each group of workers. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To examine the relationship between different    work schedules (i.e., night shift, day shift, non-shift) and QOLS, control,    opportunities in nine subdomains, the two happiness percentage measures, and    demands of work, separate multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) were    used with age as a covariate. Reported total QOLS, overall happiness, and life    satisfaction were the dependent variables for three separate ANCOVA models,    with work schedule (i.e., night shift, day shift, non-shift) as the independent    variable, with age as a covariate. Whenever age emerged as a significant covariate,    follow-up analyses clarified the age effect by stratifying each groups by age    (i.e., in two groups of <u>&lt;</u>40 years and <u>&gt;</u>41 years) and analyzing    interactions between work schedules and age. </font></p>     ^cY

These analyses showed that, among night shift workers,    the younger workers had less total QOLS (F<SUB>2,1714</SUB>=4.01, p&lt;.05),    were less happy (F<SUB>2,1686</SUB>=3.81, p&lt;.05), and less satisfied ((F<SUB>2,1602</SUB>=3.41,    p&lt;.05) than the older workers. This was reversed in day-shiftworkers, with    the younger day-shiftworkers reporting higher levels of satisfaction, happiness,    and total QOLS. </font></p>     ^cY

Taking care of themselves appears to be a priority    in workers' lives. Besides that, workers felt to have the most control and opportunities    for improvement in that domain. On the other hand, workers in each group found    the 'becoming' area least important and least satisfying. This area refers to    activities they do in everyday life to achieve personal goals, aspirations and    hopes. However, the lowest quality of life in the 'becoming' domain did not    match the lowest ratings of control and opportunities in that domain. The least    control and opportunities were found in the 'belonging' domain for all groups    of workers. It seems that workers' connection with the environment, either physical    or social, provides less control and fewer opportunities compared to other areas    of life. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The relative position of the different domains    of QOL as well as potential for control and range of opportunities was similar    across groups. However, when comparing the ratings across groups the picture    changes. Particularly, shiftworkers with night shifts rated their quality of    physical 'being' lower compared to other workers. That area deals with physical    health, including nutrition and fitness. It could be that night shiftworkers    have problems maintaining a healthy diet and physical fitness, compared to the    other groups of workers.<SUP>2</SUP> Additionally, they reported lower QOL in    spiritual matters than non-shiftworkers. They found less enjoyment in satisfying    their personal values and standards. Due to their arrangement of working hours    it is likely that night shift workers have problems in fulfilling this area    of life, as most of the activities in that domain happen in the daytime, when    shiftworkers are sleeping or feel too tired to attend. This, also, could be    one of the reasons why community 'belonging' was rated lower in night shiftworkers    than in the other two groups of workers. That area includes availability of    health and social services, educational and recreational programs and other    community events where, due to work time constrains, night workers have difficulties    in participating. In another study it was shown that average time spent in social    activities, such as theatre, visiting friends, dining out etc., was shorter    for night shifts workers compared to day workers.<SUP>18</SUP> The availability    of those kinds of activities is still very limited for night shift workers.    </font></p>     ^cY

However, the opportunity for change or enhancement in each of the nine areas    showed differences between groups. Shiftworkers with night shifts reported having    fewer opportunities to improve their physical 'being', leisure and personal    growth than the other two groups. In other words, they perceived less chance    to change or improve their physical health and fitness, to be involved in fun    activities and hobbies, or in activities that promote their knowledge    and skills. Moreover, night shift workers reported fewer opportunities to improve    their psychological 'being', i.e. individuals' feelings, cognitions and evaluations    concerning themselves, than day-shiftworkers. Compared to non-shiftworkers,    shiftworkers with night shifts also reported having fewer opportunities for    improvement in the practical 'becoming' subdomain.

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">According to the framework applied, QOL is moderated    by two factors, control and opportunity. Those two factors refer to the environment    where the individuals live, and its possibility of providing a range of opportunities    and choices. Thus, it is reasonable to combine the findings and define which    particular area seems most critical for each specific group of workers. For    night shiftworkers, the area of physical 'being' has the lowest QOLS combined    with the lowest perceived opportunities to change, as compared to the other    groups of workers. As this area is mainly concerned with physical health, including    nutrition and fitness, it is not surprising that night shiftworkers were the    group with lowest ratings. It is well documented that shiftworkers have more    health problems and poorer diets than non-shiftworkers.<SUP>2,11</SUP> Moreover,    this study reveals, through the ratings of QOL, that night shiftworkers see    physical 'being' as the most critical area in their life. </font></p>     ^cY

However, because    age emerged a significant covariate, follow-up analyses clarified the age effect    by examining the interactions between work schedules and the two age groups,    younger and older. Among night shiftworkers, the younger workers had less total    quality of life, were less happy, and less satisfied than the older workers.    This was reversed in day- shiftworkers, with the younger workers reporting higher    levels of total QOLS, happiness and satisfaction. This implies that night shift    work has a more negative impact on younger than older subjects, when it comes    to overall measures of happiness, life satisfaction, and quality of life. One    of the reasons for this finding may be the process of self-selection which occurs    among night shiftworkers, resulting in the fact that older workers are those    who better dealt with night shifts ("healthy worker effect"). On the    other side, it could be assumed that the disruptive effect of shiftwork on social    and domestic life was more pronounced in younger workers who are more occupied    with such activities during the day and thus perceive their quality of life    less satisfying than older workers. </font></p>     ^cY

This finding supports the results from a previous study.<SUP>9</SUP> However,    non-shiftworkers reported 'being' more mentally tired at the end of the day    than shiftworkers with night shift. One explanation could be that 'end of the    day' has different meanings for different groups of workers. It is possible    that the end of the day for night-shiftworkers refers to either the end of their    working day (i.e., if they are in day shift) or the end of their day-off.

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In general, results suggest that shifts, particularly    night shifts, play an important role in workers' QOL assessments and that specific    domains are more affected than others. However, it should be emphasized that    the cross-sectional nature of the present study cannot support any conclusions    on causality. Rather, results could be used in applied contexts, i.e. to identify    areas for improvement, change or intervention, which are associated with particular    working schedules. Several authors have suggested that night shifts should be    reduced as much as possible.<SUP>12</SUP> Also, there are other ways of compensating    for the negative impact of night shifts, such as improving areas of life which    are most affected by work schedules. The results of our study showed, first,    that complex QOL assessment of separate areas of life gives more information    of particular needs than overall measures of well-being. Second, the study showed    that intervention may be best targeted on areas of physical health in night    shiftworkers, furthermore, on the areas of participation in community activities,    and providing more opportunities in practical, leisure and growth area of life.    </font></p>     ^cY
