!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dealing with diversity and equity in the context    of working hours, safety and health first requires a short consideration of    the background against which this should be discussed and what is meant by equity    in this context. Health would seem to be a universal human right, and consequently    it can be found as an entitlement in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<SUP>13</SUP>    e.g. in article 25, reading "Everyone has the right to a standard of living    adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including    food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and    the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood,    old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control";    and article 2 of this declaration states that "everyone is entitled to    all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction    of any kind, such as race,     colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social    origin, property, birth or other status", which would seem to set the frame    of reference for the discussion of equity. In fact, providing for equity in    the context of health has been defined as "minimizing avoidable disparities    in health and its determinants... between groups of people who have different    levels of underlying social advantage or privilege",<SUP>2</SUP> with health    inequities having been described as "differences in health which are not    only unnecessary and avoidable but, in addition, are considered unfair and unjust".<SUP>14</SUP>    This implies that the topic to be dealt with here has a distinct political dimension,    and not only a purely scientific one. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The combination of these statements would thus    seem appropriate for setting the frame for the discussion to follow on equity    in the context of the design of work hours, i.e. avoiding any unnecessary, unfair    and unjust differences in health and well being produced by an unfair or inappropriate    design of work hours. Combining this with the ideas from ergonomics that work    should be designed in a manner as to avoid any impairments to health and well    being, this would lead to a twofold requirement: the design of working hours    should not lead to any impairments in health and well being, and especially    not to differential impairments depending on different levels of underlying    social advantage or privilege, or biological, individual, social, societal or    socioeconomic differences, which would characterize aspects or dimensions of    the diversity to be taken into account in the design of working hours and the    discussion to follow. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taking these general aspects of diversity and    their order from an individual to a macro-economic perspective would also indicate    some of the specific aspects to be dealt with. One of the first would seem to    be sex, as a relevant biological difference; – or would it be gender,    since the <I>biological</I> differences would not seem to play a major part    in the context of the effects of hours of work. Another relevant aspect is age,    since there is a lot of discussion going on about differential effects according    to age. Individual differences at a psychological level, e.g. neuroticism, morningness,    etc. would seem to play an important role, following some recent reviews of    the relevant literature.<SUP>4,8,10</SUP> Based on these reviews characteristics    of the social situation, like marital status and social integration, are other    candidates for differential and unfair effects of the design of working hours.    Extending the perspective to a societal level would make differences in cultures,    e.g. with respect to shift work or the availability of services around the clock    interesting candidates for a discussion, leading automatically to a consideration    of social values and normative regulations as causes of inequities. Finally    strategies of globalization and their effects on inequities will have to be    considered as well, since globalization might be considered one of the reasons    for a differential design of working hours with differential effects around    the globe. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Concerning biological differences the first ones    to come to one's mind are of course sex differences. There are obviously obvious    and well known differences, genetic, hormonal, stature, body mass, muscular    strength, etc.; the question, however, is how these differences relate to inequities    in the context of the effects of working hours. A closer inspection of the available    literature shows that there is not much evidence about those differences and    their effects on the effects of working hours. There is the obvious difference    of the menstrual cycle between males and females, and thus another most relevant    periodic component of behavior in females. On the other hand there is no distinct    evidence that shift work leads to a disturbance of this rhythmic control of    behavior. There are also differences in sexual behavior, but again the question    is whether these are related to working hours or their effects. The literature    does not tell much about that. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other biological differences, like body mass    or true or attributed special abilities, have not been studied in relation to    hours of work or their effects. On the other hand, however, there are a lot    of differences between men and women which make a difference with regard to    working hours, e.g. qualification, type of jobs, and working conditions. As    has been shown abundantly women in general do different jobs than men, with    in general less favorable working conditions, which cannot be related to the    biological differences. Women are still today usually and in general less (formally)    qualified, perhaps still based on the prejudice that they will marry, have children    and keep the house, so it does not pay to qualify them. This leads to poorer    jobs with poorer working and career conditions and differing working times.    One remarkable observation is that – at least in industrialized countries    – part time work is a dominant domain     for women.<SUP>5</SUP> Based on a European survey it could be shown that for    the Netherlands the proportion of the work force working part time (less than    30h) is about 60% for women, whereas only 10% of the male population works part    time. Also in shift work women are underrepresented; there are more men working    shifts than women. But this is only true in the EU for older workers, whereas    in the youngest group (15-24) there were no differences. This might thus be    an effect of child care, but it might also reflect other reasons. Although all    this might seem to be an advantage for women, the question is whether this,    e.g. higher part time engagement, is self selected or a forced choice. Looking    at differences in flexible working hours<SUP>6</SUP> enhances the suspicion    that this is forced, but not free choice, since women are much more represented    in unfavorable time arrangements. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A lot of this has to do with the second job women    usually hold: taking care of the children and the house. This definitely increases    the number of working hours and decreases the number of leisure or free time    hours for women as compared to those of men, resulting in an inequity in workload,    and most probably their effects. The additional burden of women – with    the amount of this additional burden depending, among others, on marital and    social status, education and type of job, resulting in a different amount and    proportion of paid and unpaid work – is a well known fact, however its    effects on health and well being are much less understood. It should also be    mentioned that there are differences in social support between men and women.<SUP>1</SUP>    Whereas men usually are able to cope with the stress imposed by shift work only    with the support of their wives or families, husbands and children increase    the burden imposed by shift work for women, again an inequity in workload and    most probably its effects. Although in the study by Beermann &amp; Nachreiner<SUP>1</SUP>    women did not complain more than men about health impairments, it became clear    from a closer analysis that women developed shift specific symptoms earlier    than men.<SUP>11</SUP> Here the inequities are thus not obvious but rather hidden    inequities, which might become obvious, however, if they persist for longer    times than those observed in the present studies, indicating a need for longitudinal    studies over a longer time period. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">How should we deal with such inequities? There    are usually two strategies available: (1) selection and (2) modification, with    modification differentiated into modification of people or modification of conditions,    which can again be differentiated according to the level where modification    takes place, i.e. from the shop floor to an international level. Selection on    the other hand can be differentiated into positive selection, i.e. selecting    only those for shift work who are shift work tolerant, vs. negative selection,    i.e. selecting out those who bear the risk of not tolerating shift work and    not admitting them to shift work. Positive selection, however, has been argued    not to be effective or promising since no characteristics have shown sufficient    predictive power and nothing is known about the base rate and the selection    ratio, whereas for some characteristics negative selection seems appropriate.<SUP>10</SUP>    Selection in the case of sex differences, e.g. no shift work for women, clearly    is not an appropriate solution – since it leads to other inequities. However,    no shift work during certain periods, e.g. pregnancy and child feeding, is such    a – temporary and socially acceptable – selection approach where    women are restricted from night and shift work to avoid potential inequities    due to biological diversity. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So modification would seem a more appropriate    approach, especially since most of the inequities are not due to biological    but to social differences, i.e. gender role instead of sex differences, and    thus a differential design of working hours for men and women would seem a more    effective approach, e.g. shorter hours for women, especially if they have to    take care of a family and a house, but with equal pay, thus acknowledging their    usual second job. However, this would again seem to produce inequities, since    employers would then most probably refrain from employing women. So another    change would seem to be more appropriate: changing the roles of men and women    and getting men to take over a fair share of domestic duties and to offer social    support for women working unfavorable hours. It is quite obvious that this is    a rather long term endeavor, but it would seem worth while to start immediately    to avoid some of the inequities imposed by gender roles. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A similar position on selection vs. modification    can be taken with regard to age. There is a lot of evidence concerning age related    or moderated effects of working hours.<SUP>7</SUP> A first important question,    however, would be whether increased intolerance towards shift work is a matter    of (biological) age or a matter of job age, e.g. wear and tear with years on    shift. Since both are obviously correlated, a clear distinction is necessary    in order to provide for adequate problem oriented solutions. Preventing people    from getting older is neither possible or desirable, but if the effects are    due to wear and tear rather than to chronological age appropriate measures,    e.g. modification of working conditions to avoid any tear and wear, would be    required right from the beginning of working life instead of offering the aged    and worn out a reduction of working hours to ameliorate the impairing effects.    It is thus of the utmost importance to separate the effects of age and exposure    to  adverse working conditions, like shift    work, in order to be able to provide effective approaches for avoiding inequities.    However, a lot more research on this problem needs to be done, changing to process    oriented research and avoiding the common confounding in cross sectional studies,    which of course are easier and faster to perform – and to publish. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Concerning strategies to prevent effects of wear    and tear with time (and thus with increasing age) a sound strategy is for a    design of working conditions according ergonomic criteria, i.e. providing for    workload which avoids the risk of any impairing effects. And a traditional approach    in this respect is to reduce not only the intensity of workload to an acceptable    level but also the time of exposure to the workload, since intensity and temporal    extension tend to combine in a multiplicative function. So limiting the hours    of work to a level where no impairments can be observed seems a proven and promising    approach. Avoiding inequities due to age thus requires taking work load and    especially a person's work load history into account, e.g. by <I>job age</I>,    which might be much more relevant than <I>biological age</I>, and then, in the    end, taking biological age into account, because jobs in general should be laid    out in a way that age should not matter, e.g. by respecting aging processes    right from the beginning in the design of jobs and working conditions in a prospective    instead of a corrective manner. </font></p>     ^cY

The question is, however, what we could do if there were any indication of racial    differentiation in the effects of working hours, using a – most probably    unfair – selection or a modification approach to avoid any inequities.    It seems that one of the first questions to be asked again would have to be,    whether it is really the (biological) racial differences that are leading to    inequities, or whether the undeniable racial inequities are based on racial    discrimination. In this case the strategy to deal with these inequities seems    to be very clear: avoid any racial discrimination. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As has been mentioned before, there are inequities    due to social situation, e.g. marital status. Living alone vs. living with a    partner with or without children makes a big difference, depending on the gender    of the shift worker, calling for a modification in role behaviors and support.    Social support from spouses, friends, colleagues and supervisors and social    integration with relatives and friends alleviate the burden of shift work; the    question, however is, how we can deal with this diversity to avoid inequities.    Selecting married men and unmarried women does not seem to be promising (nor    fair!). Can these inequities be compensated by adequate, differential design    of working hours, which again might cause inequities, or would a change of conditions    appear more promising?

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another point to consider is whether shift work    is embedded in a shift work culture, i.e. shift work and shift workers are something    'normal' and where provisions are made for coping with shift work, or whether    shift work is something strange with which the shift worker has to cope completely    by her/himself. Social life follows a social rhythm, resulting e.g. in an evening    and weekend society, especially in rural areas as opposed to metropolitan areas    where social activities (can) take place over extended periods of time, offering    social activities also to those with abnormal working hours. But would a change    to a 7x24h society be a suitable approach to avoid the inequities produced by    non-normal working hours? Most probably not, because destroying social rhythms    must be detrimental to social interaction. Social rhythms have a normative    function, setting up a normative time structure for reliable social interaction,    avoiding additional organizational requirements and individual efforts for coordinating    social life, as can be seen in shift work. Hours of work do also have such a    function, thus structuring behavior, at work but also off work. Instead of extending    services around the clock the question should therefore rather be whether it    is really necessary to have everything available at every time – given    the inequities produced by shift as opposed to 'normal' working hours, thus    increasing the proportion of those working abnormal working hours and living    desynchronized with the rest of one's social environment– or in the end    with no rhythm at all. Is this really something a society should strive for?    </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This opens the perspective on economic values,    with a rivalry between health and safety and economics, with an increasing dominance    on economics. This is leading to claims for extending working hours, per day,    week, year or work life, since from an economic perspective it seems to be taken    for granted that when workers work longer they work more, which of course is    not at all in agreement with ergonomic evidence, because humans do not work    like machines, it is simply not that simple! Health and safety under such a    perspective becomes a means for improved economics, with the consequence that    we should stop when it does not pay anymore or there is no (more) return on    investments. Other consequences of such a value structure are that (false) self-employment    is increasing, in order to circumvent preventive health and safety legislation    (e.g. for truck drivers or people in the mass media who work unbelievable hours)    or to avoid the costs of health and safety programs, promoting self-exploitation,    as can be seen from working hours of self employed truck drivers. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another common observation related to changes    in values and economics is an increase in precarious employment, with an increase    in flexibility or variability of working hours, uncontrolled and uncontrollable    working hours (e.g. through combinations of two or more jobs) with unknown but    most probably predictable effects for those working under such conditions, but    increased flexibility and reduced costs for business management, resulting from    reduced labor costs, surcharges or bonus payments. The question, however, is    what the gross economic costs of such a strategy at the national level are,    resulting from adverse effects on health and safety, with the associated costs    being transferred to society or the national economy. </font></p>     ^cY

One of these rather simple    strategies is to go to developing countries if labor costs are lower there (possibly    due to lower social and health and safety standards), exporting precarious work,    health and safety risks, exploitation and self exploitation, as can be seen    e.g. in the 'maquiladoras' south of the border of the USA with Mexico. </font></p>     ^cY
