!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This special issue is devoted to a refereed and    edited selection of papers presented at the <I>XVIth International Symposium    on Night and Shiftwork</I> held in Santos, Brazil, in November 2003. The journal    <I>Chronobiology International</I> has also an issue (volume 21, n. 6, 2004)    dedicated to that Symposium. Held every two years, these symposia are organised    under the auspices of the <I>Working Time Society</I> and the <I>Scientific    Committee on Shiftwork of the International Commission on Occupational Health</I>    (<a href="http://time.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/index.htm" target="_blank">http://time.iguw.tuwien.ac.at/index.htm</a>).    For many years they have been the key international gatherings of researchers    concerned with the relationships between working hours, human biology and behaviour,    health and safety. They are not only unrivalled opportunities to discuss developments    in working time research but are also important social gatherings of a close-knit,    but growing, scholarly community. The choice of venue, which broke from the    tradition of offering the symposia in isolated locations, offered an ideal combination    of an enclosed and self-sufficient conference centre, according to the attendees'    opinion. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The theme of the Santos symposium was &quot;<I>Equity    and working time: A challenge to be achieved</I>&quot;. Increasing workplace    diversity and the growing recognition of the need to manage it more equitably    are undoubtedly issues with great contemporary resonance. At least two other    recent international developments, the growth of &quot;flexible work&quot; and    the ageing of the workforce in many countries, also present significant new    challenges and opportunities for working hours research. Although workforce    ageing has attracted substantial public and political attention in recent years    (Taylor et al, 2004), little systematic consideration has been given to the    occupational health implications and working hours researchers, who for some    time have had an interest in older workers, are in a position to provide some    leadership in this regard. Various rapidly expanding forms of precarious or    contingent work, particularly short-term temporary and casual work, are often    promoted as &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;family-friendly&quot;. However, this    flexibility is most often organisational rather than individual, and frequently    leads to more diverse, and often irregular, shift systems (Golden, 2001) and    the growth of extreme work schedules that combine shiftwork with very long hours    (ACIRRT, 1999). These undesirable working hours appear to be one factor contributing    to the variety of negative effects of health and safety associated with precarious    employment (Quinlan &amp; Bohle, 2003). These developments are currently stimulating    a shift away from the traditional focus of shiftwork research on full-time workers    in ongoing employment toward a greater concern with workers in various forms    of flexible employment. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The papers published in this issue pick up the    symposium theme of equity and diversity, the ageing of the workforce and workplace    flexibility. Friedhelm Nachreiner examines the topical, though still under-researched,    issue of accommodating diversity in the design of work schedules. His provocative    overview examines equity in relation to aspects of diversity already given some    attention in working hours research (gender, marital status, social support,    age and personality) and extends to others that have received somewhat less    recognition (cultural values, socioeconomic differences). Several papers then    examine the impact of variations in working hours on variables of long standing    in shiftwork research: sleep, subjective health and wellbeing, and satisfaction.    They describe negative effects of night work on specific aspects of quality    of life (Kaliterna Lipovcan, Prizmic Larsen &amp; Zganec); the negative impact    of high variability in working hours, especially company-controlled variability,    on health and social lives (Janssen &amp; Nachreiner); the disadvantage of casual    (temporary) hotel workers in relation to unpredictable hours over which they    had little control, work-life conflict and health (Bohle, Quinlan, Kennedy &amp;    Williamson), national differences in negative impact of night shift on perceptions    of physical and mental tiredness (Tepas et al); and impact of the timing and    duration of night-time naps on the sleep and performance of night workers (Takeyama    et al). In the following paper, Radoševic-Vidacek    and Košcec report an interesting and unusual study examining the impact    of parents' work schedules on adolescents' sleep. It is unusual because the    students also attend school on weekly rotating morning and afternoon shifts.    The results indicate that adolescents with parents in shiftwork are disadvantaged    in terms of waking times, sleep duration and bedtime irregularity, particularly    when they themselves were on the &quot;morning shift&quot;. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Four papers then deal with aspects of what can    be broadly labelled &quot;work schedule design&quot;. Jeppesen and colleagues    examine the implications for shiftworkers applying different number of teams    in the shiftwork organization. They worked in different firms, sharing the same    product organization and a common corporate culture, in the same multinational    company. G&auml;rtner manuscript evaluates conflicts between employees' preferences    and ergonomic recommendations in shift scheduling. He concluded that achieving    consent does not ensure ergonomically sound schedules. And procedures of risk    assessment seem to be promising, but still is a difficult approach. Carsten    Schomann and his colleagues describe the development of a computer programme    for the design and evaluation of shift schedules (BASS 4). The new aspects implemented    in this programme included the concept of criterion functions, resulting on    the integration of workload-related aspects. Kazutaka Kogi examines industry-based    guidelines on night and shift work and enterprise-level intervention projects    to design a new checklist to facilitate the shiftwork interventions. </font></p>     ^cY

According    to Costa, a more effective and profitable adoption of preventive and compensative    measures can be achieved through a systemic approach, taking into account the    many domains involved on this issue. </font></p>     ^cY
