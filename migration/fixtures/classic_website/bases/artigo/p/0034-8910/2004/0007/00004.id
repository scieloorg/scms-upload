!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>The expansion of precarious    employment in OECD countries has been widely associated with negative health    and safety effects. Although many shiftworkers are precariously employed, shiftwork    research has concentrated on full-time workers in continuing employment. This    paper examines the impact of precarious employment on working hours, work-life    conflict and health by comparing casual employees to full-time, "permanent"    employees working in the same occupations and workplaces.    ^cY

!v704!<br>   <B>METHODS: </B>Thirty-nine convergent interviews were conducted in two five-star    hotels. The participants included 26 full-time and 13 casual (temporary) employees.    They ranged in age from 19 to 61 years and included 17 females and 22 males.    Working hours ranged from zero to 73 hours per week.    ^cY

!v704!<br>   <B>RESULTS: </B>Marked differences emerged between the reports of casual and    full-time employees about working hours, work-life conflict and health. Casuals    were more likely to work highly irregular hours over which they had little control.    Their daily and weekly working hours ranged from very long to very short according    to organisational requirements. Long working hours, combined with low predictability    and control, produced greater disruption to family and social lives and poorer    work-life balance for casuals. Uncoordinated hours across multiple jobs exacerbated    these problems in some cases. Health-related issues reported to arise from work-life    conflict included sleep disturbance, fatigue and disrupted exercise and dietary    regimes.    ^cY

!v704!<br>   <b>RESULTADOS: </b>Verificaram-se    diferen&ccedil;as acentuadas entre os informes de empregados em tempo integral    e os sem v&iacute;nculo empregat&iacute;cio sobre as horas de trabalho, conflito    trabalho-vida pessoal e sa&uacute;de. Os empregados sem v&iacute;nculo empregat&iacute;cio    tenderam a trabalhar um n&uacute;mero de horas bastante irregular sobre as quais    tinham pouco controle. Suas jornadas de trabalho di&aacute;rias e semanais eram    muito longas ou muito curtas de acordo com as exig&ecirc;ncias organizacionais.    Longas jornadas de trabalho, combinadas a baixa previsibilidade e pouco controle,    produziram maior desagrega&ccedil;&atilde;o da vida familiar e social e um pior    equil&iacute;brio entre trabalho-vida pessoal para os empregados sem v&iacute;nculo    empregat&iacute;cio. A falta de coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o das jornadas em v&aacute;rios    empregos contribu&iacute;ram para acentuar estes problemas em alguns casos.    Entre os problemas de sa&uacute;de decorrentes do conflito trabalho-vida pessoal    estavam dist&uacute;rbios do sono, cansa&ccedil;o e regimes alimentar e de exerc&iacute;cios    desestruturados.    ^cY

Little is therefore known about    the relationship between working hours and OHS in precarious employment. However,    a weak labour market position and tenuous employment are likely to mean that    many precarious employees have less control over their hours than more securely    employed workers.<SUP>10,12</SUP> Significantly, studies of full-time shiftworkers    indicate that low control over work hours leads to greater work-life conflict    and, in turn, poorer health in terms of fatigue, physical symptoms and psychological    well-being.<SUP> 17,18</SUP> There is evidence indicating that work-life conflict    arising from long or socially undesirable working hours, particularly in the    evening or on weekends, has negative effects on health.<SUP>4,21</SUP> However,    the extent to which work-life conflict arising from undesirable working hours    affects the health or safety of precarious employees has yet to be empirically    demonstrated. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Precarious employees are more likely than permanent    employees to work extremely short or extremely long hours. For example, temporary    workers may be employed only a few hours a week while the unregulated hours    of self-employed subcontractors may far exceed those of full-time employees    doing similar tasks. Mayhew &amp; Quinlan<SUP>14</SUP> (1999) found that home-based    garment workers reported longer working hours than factory-based workers, a    reflection of low earnings and task-based payment. Evidence from the USA also    indicates that part-time workers, two thirds of whom are precariously employed,    are more likely to hold two or more jobs.<SUP>12</SUP> Multiple jobholding may    pose greater safety risks (due to travel time, task reorientation and added    stress) than working longer hours in a single job. Longer hours and multiple    job holding may partially explain evidence from the Second European Workforce    Survey that precarious employees report greater fatigue.<SUP>3</SUP> </font></p>     ^cY

They included 26 full-time, continuing    employees and 13 casual employees, ranging in age from 19 to 61 years. The casual    employees were paid by the hour and had no set working hours or leave entitlements.    Seventeen of the participants were female and 22 were male. Reported average    weekly working hours ranged from 16 hours per week to 65 hours per week. Of    the 13 casual employees, 8 had another job but of the 26 full-time employees,    only 1 worked elsewhere.

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Separate convergent interviewing processes were    conducted in each hotel. Convergent interviewing<SUP>8</SUP> is a structured    process within which in-depth, non-directive interviews are conducted and interpreted.    The process iterates between data collection and interpretation, enabling researchers    to refine research questions and interpretations across a series of interviews.    Interviewers meet initially to plan the interviews. They separately interview    one respondent each and then individually summarise and interpret that interview.    After reaching tentative interpretations, the interviewers meet to compare notes,    test and refine interpretations and develop probe questions for later interviews.    The initial interviews are almost completely non-directive, starting with broad    questions that impose minimal constraints on responses and slowly moving to    more specific probe questions. Later interviews begin with the same broad questions    but become more focused toward the end, when probe questions are used to explore    and clarify issues from previous interviews. </font></p>     ^cY

Casuals reported    substantially greater variation in working hours than full-time staff. For many,    starting times and shift durations varied markedly from day to day, depending    on a variety of organisational and environmental factors, such as conference    or seminar bookings and the various seasonal, economic and social cycles that    affected occupancy rates. In the food and beverage division of one hotel, two    full-time employees also reported very long hours, up to 54 hours per week in    one case and a maximum of over 70 in another.

The shift durations reported ranged from two    hours to 18 hours and start and finishing times for shifts were highly variable.    Many casuals were only advised of the starting times for their shifts in advance,    with finishing times being decided by a manager or supervisor at some time during    the shift. Some casuals were asked to do split shifts with little warning (for    example, after they had commenced work on the shift). They could be sent home    within a few hours of starting a shift and asked to return several hours later.    One worker, for example, reported being required to work from 6:00 am to 9:00    am and then having to remain nearby until he was required again from 2:00 pm    to 6:00 pm. To do seven hours of work, he had to invest 15 hours of his time;    he left home at 4:30 am and did not arrive home again until approximately 7:30    pm.

For example, an experienced maid working in    the housekeeping department described constant pressure from having to clean    13 rooms in each eight-hour shift. One woman reported that she did not take    a meal break, or any other break, at work for the first three months she was    employed in housekeeping. Thereafter, she had taken one 30-minute break per    shift.

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Variability and unpredictability of working hours    were significant sources of work-life conflict for the casual staff. Hours were    excessive in some weeks and insufficient in others. The negative effects of    unpredictability were compounded by a lack of control over hours. One casual    worker reported that the work schedule could "change three or four times    a week". Another reported, "I don't make plans for anything. The roster    will change quite immensely. Things will be added, shifts will be changed".    </font></p>     ^cY

Both the hotels studied were in central city locations and some    workers lived in distant suburbs that necessitated long commuting times. One    casual reported having to commute for three hours to do two or three hours'    work when shifts were split or curtailed without warning. Some casual employees    reported they were only told of shift allocations one or two days before the    work schedule commenced, with negative effects on their capacity to organise    their family and social lives effectively. Others reported that tiredness and    negative mood associated with long working hours had a negative impact on relationships    at home. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The findings concerning working hours indicated    that, in the same workplaces and doing the same jobs, casual employees had much    less desirable work schedules. Casuals were exposed to unpredictable variations    in both daily and weekly working hours. Most had experienced periods during    which they worked very long daily and weekly hours. Casual employees reported    less control over their hours, not the greater flexibility that employers often    claim is a benefit of casual employment. Concerns about fatigue reported by    casuals were linked to both long hours and the unpredictability of those hours.    There was also stronger agreement amongst casuals that their work schedules    generated work-life conflict than there was amongst full-time workers. Casuals    reported greater difficulties with sleep, time for family and social relationships,    diet and participation in sport, regular exercise and other recreation. </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In relation to methodology and interpretation,    it is important to note that some of the negative effects of precarious employment    may extend to workers who are more securely employed in the same industry or    workplace. The presence of precarious employees may produce pressures that diminish    the working conditions of all workers, for example by increasing demands on    more secure workers to absorb a greater volume of work or take on additional    tasks and supervision due to reductions in the full-time workforce.<SUP>2</SUP>    This phenomenon, if present, would reduce apparent differences between precarious    and more secure workers employed in the same workplace. In the present study,    for example, the presence of precarious employees may have contributed to the    excessive work intensity reported by permanent employees. It is also unclear    to what extent the results of a qualitative case study such as this one     can be generalised. The case study approach does, however, provide insights    that would be difficult to get from quantitative methods and provides rich data    from which items can be developed for questionnaire surveys. Rigorous surveys,    in turn, provide a better basis for systematic assessment of the generalisability    of the results. The authors are currently conducting a survey of this nature.    </font></p>     ^cY

!v704!<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Subject to these methodological limitations,    the present findings suggest that one form of precarious employment, casual    work, can carry significant disadvantages in terms of working hours, work-life    conflict and health. Casual work is also likely to present a particularly intractable    challenge to the regulation of working hours. Not only does the limited organisational    power wielded by many casual employees result in them having a diminished capacity    to exert control over work schedules and protect themselves from the most undesirable    shift allocations but, for various interrelated reasons, they are also likely    to derive limited benefit from legal regulation. Trade union membership is often    low amongst casuals, limiting wider advocacy of their interests, and a combination    of non-standard working hours, multiple jobs and fear of reporting illness or    injury may make them less visible to OHS inspectors. In view of the disadvantages    they may face in relation to working hours, work-life conflict and health, casual    workers warrant more extensive attention in shiftwork research than they have    attracted to date. </font></p>     ^cY
