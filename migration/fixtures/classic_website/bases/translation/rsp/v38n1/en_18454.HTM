<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To evaluate the effect of intramuscular 
  injection of artemether in mice experimentally infected with <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, 
  at the time of infection, during schistosomula maturation and after the beginning 
  of egg-laying.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Eighty adult females Balb/c mice were 
  divided into 8 groups with 10 animals each. Seven groups were infected with 
  <i>S. mansoni</i> using 60 cercariae for each animal, inoculated subcutaneously, 
  and the remaining group was maintained without infection. Among the seven infected 
  groups, six were treated with artemether, according to the following schedule: 
  three groups received doses of 100 mg/kg on days 0, 20 or 60 after inoculation 
  of the cercariae; the other three received 50 mg/kg of artemether, also on days 
  0, 20 or 60. At the end of the 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> 
  weeks after infection all the mice infected with <i>S. mansoni</i> were submitted 
  to fecal examination using the Kato-Katz technique. On the 80<sup>th</sup> day 
  of the experiment, the surviving animals were sacrificed and submitted to perfusion 
  of the portal system in order to recover the worms. Body, liver and spleen weights 
  of each animal were determined at that time.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>A reduction in egg-laying and the number 
  of worms recovered was observed in mice treated with artemether (50 or 100 mg/kg) 
  on the 20<sup>th</sup> day after infection. The decrease in the number of worms 
  was more notable among <i>S. mansoni</i> females. A significant decrease in 
  liver and spleen weights was also seen on the 20<sup>th</sup> day among animals 
  treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg of artemether and also among those that received 
  the drug at a dose of 50 mg/kg 60 days after infection.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Evidence of the antischistosomal activity 
  of artemether was shown, even at a dose of 50 mg/kg, when the drug was administered 
  during the schistosomula maturation period in the portal system of the vertebrate 
  host. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"> <b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is believed that at least 2.5 million people in Brazil carry 
  <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> and around 25 million individuals are exposed to 
  the risk of contracting it.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two drugs have been widely used in the treatment of the disease, 
  with good efficacy and low toxicity: oxamniquine and praziquantel. Over recent 
  years, the latter has been used preferentially. In view of the possible development 
  of tolerance or resistance to praziquantel, research into and production of 
  new drugs for the prevention and cure of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> has become 
  justified.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Artemisinin derivatives, which are used with efficacy in the 
  treatment of malaria, have also been shown to have anti-<i>Schistosoma</i> activity, 
  especially artemether. The schistosomicide action of artemisinin was discovered 
  in 1980 by Chinese scientists. In their study, when it was administered to animals 
  infected experimentally with <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>, it caused a marked 
  reduction in worm load in comparison with control animals that were not treated 
  (Chen et al <i>apud</i> Utzinger et al,<sup>11</sup> 2001). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1982, Le et al<sup>7</sup> confirmed the schistosomicide 
  property of artemether. Mice or dogs infected with <i>S</i>. <i>japonicum</i> 
  and treated with this drug at various doses and utilizing different administration 
  routes showed a significant reduction in worm load. The larval phases (schistosomulae) 
  of <i>S. japonicum </i>were also shown to be susceptible to artemether. However, 
  no effect was observed on trematode eggs.<sup>15</sup> Subsequent studies have 
  confirmed that other artemisinin derivatives have schistosomicide properties: 
  artesunate,<sup>3,8</sup> arteether<sup>14</sup> and, recently, dihydroartemisinin.<sup>1</sup> 
  In 1991 in Brazil, Araújo et al<sup>2</sup> studied artemether activity in hamsters 
  and mice experimentally infected with <i>S. mansoni</i>, 45 days after penetration 
  by the cercariae. Better results were also observed when the drug was administered 
  via intramuscular route.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The present work has sought to evaluate the effect of the intramuscular 
  administration of artemether in mice experimentally infected with <i>S. mansoni</i>, 
  at the time of infection, during schistosomula maturation and after the beginning 
  of egg-laying. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eighty adult female mice of the Balb/c lineage 
  were utilized, divided into eight subgroups: six infected with <i>S. mansoni</i> 
  and treated using artemether, one equally infected but not treated with artemether 
  and, finally, one other subgroup that was not infected and not treated, as shown 
  in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mice in subgroups 1 to 7 were each infected with 60 cercariae 
  of the BH strain of <i>S. mansoni</i>, via subcutaneous route. The BH strain 
  of this trematode has been kept for more than 15 years in the schistosomiasis 
  immunopathology laboratory of Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo (São 
  Paulo Institute of Tropical Medicine), by utilizing specimens of <i>Biomphalaria 
  glabrata</i> and hamsters. The inoculation of 60 cercariae was achieved by 1:6 
  dilution of an aliquot that contained 1800 cercariae per ml, with 0.2 ml injected 
  into each mouse. The artemether, at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, was administered 
  via intramuscular route to the mice in subgroups 1 to 6.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The effect of the artemether was evaluated by means of quantitative 
  examination of feces, done according to the Kato-Katz method<sup>6</sup> in 
  the 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> weeks after the infection. 
  Eighty days after the start of the experiment, the surviving animals were sacrificed 
  and submitted to perfusion of the portal system for the recovery and counting 
  of the worms present, according to the technique recommended by Pellegrino &amp; 
  Siqueira.<sup>10</sup> At that time, the body, liver, and spleen weights of 
  each mouse were determined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throughout the experiment the mice received feed and water <i>ad 
  libitum</i> and their management was in accordance with the recommendations 
  of the Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal (Brazilian College for Animal 
  Experimentation).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results were analyzed via non-parametric statistical tests, 
  utilizing a significance level of 95% (p=0.05).</font></p>

  day after infection with doses of 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively, there 
  was a marked reduction in the number of eggs found</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schistosomiasis continues to occupy second position in the world 
  among parasites, after malaria, in terms of the extent of endemic areas and 
  number of people infected. Treatment using praziquantel is efficacious in the 
  reduction of morbidity, although it fails to prevent reinfection. Thus, foci 
  with high transmission rates still exist in endemic areas, despite the regular 
  administration of this drug.<sup>13</sup> In view of the possible development 
  of tolerance and/or resistance to this drug, research into new alternatives 
  for the prevention and cure of schistosomiasis have become justified.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Artemisinin (qinghaosu) is the main active agent extracted from 
  the leaves of <i>Artemisia annua, </i>a plant that is widely disseminated in 
  China and which also grows naturally in Central Europe, the United States and 
  Argentina. Its antimalarial activity was confirmed in 1971 and more than two 
  million patients with malaria have been treated with this drug and its derivatives 
  (artemether, artesunate and arteether) over that last 20 years.<sup>11</sup> 
  The antischistosomal activity of artemisinin was discovered in 1980, when it 
  was observed that its administration to animals experimentally infected with 
  <i>S. japonicum</i> caused a marked reduction in the worm load, in comparison 
  with control animals that were not treated.<sup>11</sup> These results were 
  confirmed by the findings of Le et al<sup>7</sup> (1982). In their turn, Yue 
  et al<sup>15 </sup>(1984) verified the susceptibility of the schistosomulae 
  of <i>S. japonicum</i> to artemether. They did not, however, observe any effect 
  of this drug on the eggs of this trematode. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An experimental study made by Chinese researchers showed that 
  artemether had greater activity against <i>S. mansoni</i> when the drug, used 
  at a high dose (400 mg/kg), was utilized during the phase of schistosomula evolution 
  (14 to 21 days after penetration by the cercariae), with lesser activity shown 
  in relation to adult worms. A study done in Brazil (Araújo et al,<sup>2</sup> 
  1991) confirmed the moderate reduction in parasite load when artemether was 
  used in mice carrying adult specimens of <i>S. mansoni</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The present work sought to utilize lower doses 
  of artemether, closer to those utilized in human beings in the treatment of 
  malaria, with the objective of simulating situations that could arise in regions 
  where malaria and schistosomiasis are endemic. The results obtained similarly 
  suggested that there is greater activity of artemether on schistosomulae (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>). In the animals in subgroups 2 and 5 (infected and treated with 100 mg 
  and 50 mg of artemether per kg of weight, on the 20<sup>th</sup> day after infection, 
  at which time the maturation of the schistosomulae was taking place), fewer 
  worms were recovered after the perfusion of the portal system. These results 
  were confirmed by the absence or low counts of eggs in the feces of mice in 
  these subgroups in the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> weeks after infection 
  (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). These finding partially coincide with those of 
  Xiao &amp; Catto<sup>12</sup> (1989) and Xiao et al<sup>13</sup> (2000), who 
  worked with mice infected with <i>S. mansoni</i> and observed that the parasites 
  aged 14 and 21 days were the ones most susceptible to artemether. It should 
  be stressed that lower mortality was observed in the subgroups treated with 
  artemether (with the exception of subgroup 3, which received the drug when the 
  S. mansoni specimens were already fully developed), than in subgroup 7 (mice 
  infected with <i>S. mansoni</i> and not treated with artemether).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The animals in subgroups 3 and 6 – treated 60 
  days after infection, with 100 mg and 50 mg of artemether per kg of weight – 
  presented lower numbers of female worms after the perfusion (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>) and the egg count was negative in the last week of the experiment (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). Evidence was thus shown of the antiparasitic activity of artemether, 
  especially in relation to schistosomulae and females of <i>S. mansoni</i>, even 
  when lower doses of this drug were utilized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Brazil, there is practically no overlap between the endemic 
  areas for malaria and schistosomiasis. However, in certain regions of the African 
  continent, the transmission of these parasitoses takes place concomitantly, 
  and the results from the use of praziquantel have been less promising than what 
  was expected<sup>5</sup>. In these circumstances, the use of artemisinin derivatives 
  with the aim of treating malaria cases may exert a significant influence on 
  the reduction of the morbidity rate due to endemic schistosomiasis. </font></p>
