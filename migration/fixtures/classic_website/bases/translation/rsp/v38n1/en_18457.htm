<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To investigate the history of accidental 
  falls reported by older adults, identifying possibly related factors, as well 
  as place of occurrence, causes, and consequences.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The sample investigated included 50 older adults, of both sexes, 
  ages 60 years or older, living in the city of Ribeirão Preto, Southeastern Brazil, 
  who had been seen at two inpatient units of a public hospital. Patient records 
  were examined and household visits carried out for the application of a structured 
  questionnaire including open, closed, and mixed questions related to the fall.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Data obtained show a reality not substantially 
  different from that observed in other countries. Most events occurred among 
  older women (66%), with mean age 76 years, and at home. Causes were mainly related 
  to physical environment (54%), and brought serious consequences to the subjects, 
  fractures being the most common outcome (64%). Falls had a great impact on subjects’ 
  lives in terms of activities such as: lying down/getting up, walking on plain 
  surfaces, cutting toenails, bathing/showering, walking outside home, taking 
  care of financial issues, shopping, using public transportation, and climbing 
  stairs.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The study demonstrated that falls 
  occurred among older adults have serious physical, psychological, and social 
  consequences, reinforcing the need for fall prevention, in order to ensure greater 
  quality of life, autonomy, and independence for the elderly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aging may be influenced by biological factors, disease, and 
  other external causes. Falls are included among the latter, according to the 
  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 
  (ICD-10).<sup>15</sup> They pose a problem of great importance to gerontologists, 
  and are a source of concern for researchers in the field, especially when they 
  are considered as normal and proper of the ageing process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A fall can be defined as “an unintentional event resulting in 
  a change in the individual’s position from a higher to a lower level”.<sup>14</sup> 
  According to Cunha &amp; Guimarães<sup>7</sup> (1989), falls are the result 
  of a total loss of postural balance, and may be related to a sudden insufficiency 
  of neural and osteoarticular mechanisms involved in posture maintenance. A number 
  of authors<sup>6,13,18</sup> consider accidental falls as a geriatric syndrome, 
  due to their multifactorial and heterogeneous character. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Individuals of all ages are at risk of falling. For older adults, 
  however, falls have a much greater relevance, for they can lead to disability, 
  injuries, and death. The social cost of falls is enormous, and becomes even 
  greater when the aged victim suffers reductions in autonomy and independence, 
  or needs to be institutionalized. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In US emergency services, falls are frequent injury-causing 
  events, and constitute the most important etiology of accidental death among 
  individuals over age 65 years.<sup>8</sup> Accidental lesions are the sixth 
  greatest cause of mortality in the &gt;75 years age group, accounting for 70% 
  of this mortality.<sup>10</sup> According to German government data, in 1996, 
  11/100,000 individuals died after suffering injuries caused by accidental falls<sup>1</sup>. 
  In Brazil, according to data from the Ministry of Health’s Medical Information 
  System, between 1979 and 1995, approximately 54,730 people died due to falls, 
  of which 52% were older adults and 39.8% were in the 80-89 years age group. 
  Still according to data from this institution, the nosocomial mortality rate 
  due to falls in February 2000 was 2.58%. The greatest rate was observed in the 
  Southeast Region, followed by Northeast, South, and Center-West. In Finland, 
  Kannus et al<sup>9</sup> (1999) observed an 80% increase in the number of fall-related 
  between 1971 (441 deaths) and 1995 (793 deaths).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surveys conducted in US communities show that 30% of people 
  over age 65 years fall at least once a year. Of these, 40% are over 80 years 
  old. Furthermore, these surveys show that 50% of elderly people who live in 
  residential or nursing homes have already suffered falls.<sup>19</sup> Kannus 
  et al<sup>9 </sup>(1999), in a study carried out in Finland among individuals 
  older than 50 years, reported a significant increase (284%) in the number of 
  injuries among older adults between the years of 1971 and 1995. The authors 
  argue that two factors may have contributed towards this increase: demographical 
  alterations (a continuous increase in older-adult population) and an increase 
  in the number of falls in this age group. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the evidence supporting an increase in the number of 
  falls among older-adult population, Brazilian geriatric and gerontological literature 
  contains few epidemiological studies on the subject. According to Becker et 
  al<sup>1</sup> (1999), the same problem is observed in Germany. In order to 
  allow potential preventive interventions to be indicated by further studies, 
  the present study deepens the investigation of falls among older adults. Thus, 
  our aim is to investigate the history of falls reported by elderly subjects, 
  considering place of occurrence, causes, and consequences, and to describe any 
  changes occurred in subjects’ daily lives, after the fall, including those related 
  to functional capabilities: alterations in basic daily life activities (BDLA) 
  and in instrumental daily life activities (IDLA).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Study population was composed of individuals over age 60 years, 
  of both sexes, with fixed residence in the city of Ribeirão Preto, Southeastern 
  Brazil, who were seen, due to external causes of accidental trauma – Falls – 
  ICD-10 (W00 – W19),<sup>15 </sup>at two inpatient units of a university hospital 
  in the same city in 2000. Data on the older adults seen at the above mentioned 
  units who had Falls diagnosed in their records were provided by the hospital’s 
  Medical Data Department. Following the identification of study population, older 
  adults who did not live in Ribeirão Preto or who had also been seen at the hospital’s 
  Emergency Unit and then transferred within the same hospital for a longer admission 
  period were excluded. Study population thus comprised 251 older adults seen 
  in 2000, from which a 50-subject sample was systematically drawn (random start 
  one, skip five). Information including name, age, fall history, inpatient admission 
  were obtained from the hospital records of the selected subjects in order to 
  verify the information concerning the fall obtained through these files. Name 
  and address were recorded for subsequent household interviews. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Subjects were visited at their homes, where structured interviews, 
  including closed, open, and mixed questions, were carried out in order to obtain 
  additional information such as: subject identification, detailed reports on 
  the fall, and any changes in lifestyle occurred following the incident. The 
  latter included functional capability restrictions observed in BDLA (eating, 
  lying down/getting up, walking on plain surfaces, bathing/showering, dressing 
  up, combing hair, cutting toenails, brushing teeth, and difficulties using the 
  lavatory) and IDLA (taking medicine at the right time, climbing stairs, walking 
  outside home, taking care of financial issues, shopping, using public transportation, 
  and preparing meals). The present study adopts the protocol proposed by Yuaso 
  &amp; Sguizzatto<sup>21</sup> (1996), elaborated based on the Katz and Lawton 
  scales, for daily activity evaluation purposes. Subject interviews were preformed 
  in the presence of a family member (or caretaker), who confirmed and helped 
  clarify the data obtained. When the subject suffered from any cognitive dysfunction 
  that impeded questionnaire answering, questions were asked to the family member/caretaker. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A number of subjects had died or moved to different addresses 
  before interview scheduling. In case of death, questions were answered by a 
  family member/caretaker that could provide information about the incident. In 
  case of change of address (when a new address could not be found) the lost subject 
  was replaced by another subject of same sex and age, according to the general 
  patient listing. A total 26 subjects were replaced. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This research project was approved by the <i>Hospital das Clínicas</i> 
  of the <i>Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto</i>/<i>Universidade de São 
  Paulo</i> Ethics Committee.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the selected subjects, 66% were female and 34%, male. Mean 
  age was 76 years. 54% of the subjects interviewed had a history of previous 
  falls, of which 48% were in the 80-89 years age group and 66% were women. Inadequate 
  surroundings were the main cause of falls (54%), followed by neurological disease 
  (14%) and heart disease (10%). The cause for 10% of all falls was ignored. Most 
  falls were from the subject’s own height, and related to problems in the surroundings, 
  including: slippery surfaces (26%), objects on the floor (22%), bumping into 
  other people (11%), climbing on objects in order to reach for things (7%), problems 
  with steps (7%), and others, in lesser degree. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the incident, a number of subjects reported the appearance 
  of diseases such as: cerebrovascular accident (10%) osteoporosis, (4%), pneumonia 
  (4%), arthritis (2%), urinary tract infection (2%) and cardiopathy (2%). Sensorial 
  diseases were also reported, of which 36% were related to visual problems, and 
  14% to hearing problems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No direct relationship was observed between medication use and 
  falls. However, data collection revealed that 70% of subjects were on some type 
  of medication prior to the incident, all of which were physician-prescribed. 
  No significant difference was found in terms of medication use between men (70%) 
  and women (72%). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows that most 
  frequently used medication were anti-hypertensive drugs (34%), followed by glycemic 
  control drugs (14%) and others. A large number of subjects used several drugs 
  simultaneously. The use of multiple drugs was verified in 42% of the subjects 
  who used medication prior to the fall. </font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18457f1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">66% of falls occurred in the subjects own home, and 22% out 
  of doors. The remainder occurred in the houses of relatives or friend’s. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The consequence most commonly observed in this 
  study were fractures (64%), occurred in 53% of men and 70% of women. Most common 
  fractures were of the femur (62% of total fractures), followed by radius (12.5%), 
  clavicle (6.25%), and others (spinal column, ulna, scapula, patella, and nose). 
  Following the occurrence of fractures, consequences most reported were fear 
  further falls (44%) and others presented in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18457f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to subject and family member/caretaker reports, falls 
  also promoted increases in difficulty and dependence for the performance of 
  daily-life activities (DLA). The Table shows the number of subjects who carried 
  out these activities before and after the fall, according to the levels of difficulty 
  presented by them. DLAs most affected were lying down/getting up, walking on 
  plain surfaces, bathing/showering, walking outside home, taking care of financial 
  issues, cutting toenails, shopping, using public transportation, and climbing 
  stairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As mentioned before, falls may cause the death of older adults. 
  Fourteen (28%) subjects in the sample had died, of which 78.5% were women and 
  21.5% men. 42.8% of deaths occurred less than one month after the fall, i.e., 
  due to consequences directly related to the incident, including femur fracture-related 
  embolism (50%) and neurological lesions due to intense trauma after the fall 
  (50%). The other 57.2% of deaths occurred less than one year after the fall. 
  Many of the subjects were bedridden, and presented mental confusion, pneumonia, 
  and pressure ulcers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The greater frequency of falls oberved among women is consistent 
  with data presented by Berg et al<sup>2</sup> (1997). These authors include 
  among the variables which may account for this difference advanced age, lower 
  frequency of external activities, use of large quantities of drugs, use of psychotropic 
  drugs, and decreased prehensile strength.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The causes of falls among older adults are several and may be 
  associated among themselves. Factors responsible for these falls have been classified 
  in the literature as intrinsic – i.e., due to physiological alterations related 
  to the aging process, disease, and to medication effects – and extrinsic – i.e., 
  factors that depend on social and environmental circumstances that are challenges 
  for the elderly. In general, environment-related problems are caused by occasional 
  events that pose risks to older adults, especially to those who already present 
  difficulties in balance or gait. Situations that favor slipping, tripping, false 
  steps, or bumping (into objects, animals, or other people) must be considered. 
  Such problems will be more dangerous the greater the individual’s vulnerability 
  and the greater the instability that the problem may cause. Generally speaking, 
  older adults do not fall as a consequence of dangerous activities (climbing 
  ladders or on chairs) but as a result of routine activities. In the present 
  study, only two cases of falls were due to risky activities (one due to climbing 
  on a chair to reach for something, and another doe to climbing on scaffolding). 
  Problems related to the environment were also the most frequent causes in the 
  study by Berg et al<sup>2 </sup>(1997). In this study, tripping and slipping 
  accounted for 59% of falls, and problems with steps for 12%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among intrinsic factors, the appearance of diseases that cause 
  reductions of physical capabilities may affect postural control or balance. 
  Major pathological conditions leading to falls, according to Kay et al<sup>10</sup> 
  (1995) and Lipsitz,<sup>12</sup> (1996), are: <i>cardiovascular, neurological, 
  endocrinologic, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, psychiatric, and sensorial diseases</i>. 
  Several studies in the literature show the relationship between falls and sensorial 
  deficits.<sup>10,13</sup> In the present investigation, however, there were 
  no reports of direct relationships between visual or hearing problems and falling. 
  This may be due to subjects’ difficulty in admitting such deficiencies or in 
  seeing a relationship between these difficulties and the fall. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to presenting a relationship to previously diagnosed 
  diseases, some authors suggest that falls may be a predictor for other health 
  problems, and may indicate the imminence of a disease not yet diagnosed.<sup>10</sup> 
  Many infectious diseases are clinically atypical in older adults, and falls 
  may be the first sign of illness.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Several studies found in the literature concerning medication 
  use – also considered as a potential intrinsic cause of falls, and investigated 
  in the present study – report that drug use may be a risk factor, especially 
  if multiple drugs are used. Brito et al<sup>3 </sup>(2001) report that medications 
  such as diuretic, psychotropic, anti-hypertensive, and antiparkinsonian drugs 
  may be considered as liable to cause falls. This is often due to diminutions 
  in motor function, muscular weakness, fatigue, vertigo, or postural hypotension, 
  all of which may be caused by these drugs. The findings related to the use of 
  multiple drugs in the present study are in agreement with those of Robbins et 
  al<sup>16</sup> (1989). These authors state that the use, by older adults, of 
  four or more associated drugs may lead to a greater risk of falling, due to 
  the strong association between different drugs, or to the precarious health 
  status implied by treatment with multiple drugs. Thus, it is essential that 
  professionals, upon prescribing medication, thoroughly evaluate the real need 
  for the drugs prescribed, given the close relationship between the use of new 
  drugs, or even of dosage adjustment, and increased risk of falling. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The site of the fall is also important for environment-related 
  factor identification purposes. In a retrospective study carried out in Ribeirão 
  Preto with older women of the community who had suffered falls, a larger proportion 
  of falls in the subject’s own home was also verified.<sup>17</sup> Campbell 
  et al<sup>5</sup> (2000), in an investigation of accidents among older adults 
  living in a community, found that falls accounted for 51% of the accidents registered, 
  and that they occurred mostly inside the subject’s own house (44% of falls). 
  These data are extremely elucidative for the planning of preventive measures 
  for falls among the elderly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the subjects of the present study, fractures were the 
  most common consequence of falls. However, the fact that the individuals participating 
  in the study were recruited at inpatient hospital units may have interfered 
  in these results, since these are the individuals that present the severest 
  consequences immediately after the fall. Kannus et al<sup>9</sup> in Finland 
  and Becker et al<sup>1</sup> in Germany also identified fractures, especially 
  of the femur, as the most frequent consequence of falls among older adults. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fear of further falls, also known as the “post-fall syndrome” 
  (the second consequence most reported by study subjects), was also reported 
  by several authors<sup>1,16,20</sup> Post-fall fear may imply fear not only 
  of further falls, but also of injuries, hospital admission, immobilization, 
  declining health, and of dependence on other people for self-care or for daily 
  life activities, or, in other words, of the consequences inherent to falling.<sup>11</sup> 
  The cumulative effect of such feelings may bring about important emotional, 
  psychological and social changes, such as: loss of autonomy and independence 
  for BDLA and IDLA, reduction of social activities, and feelings of fragility 
  and insecurity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For DLAs walking on plain surfaces, lying down/getting 
  up, and bathing/showering, subjects presented loss of independence after the 
  fall, mostly due to impaired functional capabilities (<a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>). Such activities, previously carried out with less difficulty, became 
  problematic after the fall. For DLAs shopping, using public transportation, 
  and climbing stairs, subjects presented greater locomotion dependence after 
  the fall. Climbing stairs was one of the activities most affected. Housecleaning, 
  preparing food, and taking medication were already performed fairly rarely by 
  subjects even before the fall, and were usually done by other persons, mostly 
  relatives. Brushing teeth, getting to the lavatory in time, combing hair, and 
  eating were the activities least affected by falling. </font></p>
<p><a name="tab1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18457t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Carvalhaes et al<sup>6</sup> (1998) report that individuals 
  in the 75-84 years age group that require help in order to perform DLAs are 
  at a 14-fold risk of falling if compared to independent individuals. Refraining 
  from carrying out such activities, or even requiring help for such purposes, 
  may cause immobility and consequent muscular dystrophy, thus facilitating the 
  occurrence of falls. When older adults fall, there is a trend towards diminution 
  of daily activities, be it due to fear of exposure to risk of further falls, 
  be it due to protective attitudes on the part of society and family members/caretakers. 
  Other people may consider the older adult that falls as weak, often withdrawing 
  him or her from such activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All the difficulties presented by the subjects of the present 
  study were in some way related to consequences of fall, be they physical, psychological, 
  or social. The impact upon DLA performance increased subject dependence on other 
  persons, especially for IDLAs. Changes were observed even in activities previously 
  performed with ease and without external help. The inability to perform DLAs 
  due to fall-related immobility may, in the long run, have consequences not only 
  for the older adults themselves, but also for their families – who must mobilize 
  themselves in order to provide treatment and promote the recovery of the older 
  adult – and for health services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Accidental injuries are the sixth most important cause of death 
  among individuals aged 75 years or older, and falls account for 70% of this 
  mortality.<sup>12</sup> The importance of falls must not be underestimated, 
  since they may result in death. In the present study, death following a fall 
  occurred more frequently among women, in disagreement with data presented by 
  Campbell et al<sup>4</sup> (1985) in a prospective study in which a greater 
  risk of mortality was ascribed to male subjects. The greater mortality among 
  women in the present study may be related to the greater absolute number female 
  fallers. Fractures, one of the consequences of falls that may lead to death, 
  may be related to the greater frequency of osteoporosis among older women, in 
  light of the strong association between this disease and fractures. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is important to emphasize that falls are a real event in 
  older adult life, bringing about a number of consequences, sometimes irreversible. 
  Therefore, the approach to fall victims must include a broad and complete evaluation. 
  Healthcare professionals must thus carry out thorough anamneses of the causes 
  of the incident. At this time, knowing about the existence of any previous falls 
  may direct evaluation. A detailed investigation of the role of extrinsic factors 
  (environment, clothing) is important. Such evaluation may prevent further incidents, 
  as well as promote a better understanding of the present fall. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another form of dealing with falls is their prevention by means 
  of household visits. The Brazilian National Older-Adult Healthcare Policy is 
  already considering this type of assistance. To this end, it will be necessary 
  for states and municipalities to train healthcare professionals and to organize 
  healthcare services so that older adult assistance becomes a governmental policy. 
  Healthcare programs must establish protocols for the identification of potential 
  intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for falling. A further aspect is to reinforce 
  the importance of self-care and to alert family members/caretakers so that they 
  may actively participate in the prevention of falls among older adults.   </font></p>
