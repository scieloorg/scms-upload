<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> To quantify psychoactive drug use and investigate use-related 
  variables among students of Assis, Brazil, a questionnaire was administered 
  to collect sociodemographic data and identify the pattern of non-medical use 
  of psychoactive drugs in 20% of public and private school students. The largest 
  consumption indexes for <i>lifetime use</i> were seen for alcohol (68.9%) and 
  tobacco (22.7%). Drugs most often used were: solvents (10.0%); marijuana (6.6%); 
  benzodiazepines (3.8%); amphetamines (2.6%); cocaine (1.6%); and anticholinergics 
  (1.0%). </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Drug consumption has become a major concern in the Brazilian 
  society. Epidemiological research on psychoactive drug use is especially relevant 
  for the development of appropriate and successful public health policies for 
  preventing substance abuse (Bucher,<sup>2</sup> 1992).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many studies on psychoactive drug use have been carried out 
  among young students in Brazil (Bucher,<sup>2</sup> 1992; Muza et al,<sup>4</sup> 
  1997). The most comprehensive ones were conducted by the CEBRID – <i>Centro 
  Brasileiro de Informações sobre Drogas Psicotrópicas</i> (Brazilian Data Institute 
  on Psychoactive Drugs). The Institute has carried out surveys in 10 different 
  Brazilian capitals in 1987, 1989, 1993, and 1997 (Galduróz et al,<sup>3</sup> 
  1997). The purpose of the present study was to quantify psychoactive drug use 
  among students in the city of Assis, São Paulo, Brazil, and to investigate drug 
  use-related variables. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Study subjects comprised middle and high school students of 
  Assis in the state of São Paulo. With a population of 87,251 inhabitants, Assis 
  is located 450 km far from the state’s capital. The study sample consisted of 
  20% of total students in 18 city schools and 1,803 questionnaires were administered 
  in public schools and 320 in private schools. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">School classes were randomly drawn at the time of questionnaire 
  administration and proportionally to school, term, and school year. Trained 
  university students simultaneously administered questionnaires to all classes 
  in the school to prevent students from knowing beforehand the questionnaires’ 
  contents. Students were informed on the study’s purposes and asked to participate 
  voluntarily and anonymously. Only students in class at the time of questionnaire 
  application were included in the study. Teachers were asked to leave the classroom 
  to avoid making students uncomfortable. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was applied a close anonymous self-administered questionnaire, 
  similar to that used by Galduróz et al<sup>1</sup> (1997), which was developed 
  according to World Health Organization criteria. There were 43 questions on 
  pattern of psychotropic use, students’ school attendance, and sociodemographic 
  data based on the ABIPEME – <i>Associação Brasileira dos Institutos de Pesquisa 
  de Mercado</i> (Brazilian Institute Association of Market Research)<sup>1</sup> 
  socioeconomic rating system. A question with fictitious drug names was included 
  to detect inconsistencies and lack of attention when answering the questionnaire. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Classification criteria for drug use frequency 
  were based on Galduróz et al.,<sup>3 </sup>1997. These authors defined five 
  drug use patterns: lifetime, yearly, monthly, regular, and heavy use.<a name="1nota"></a><a href="#nota"><sup>*</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Answers were entered in a data base (Microsoft Excel 2000 electronic 
  table). Data analysis was performed using Statistics 5.0 (1995) and Minitab 
  (1994) software programs. Chi-square test was used for comparison. Significance 
  level was set at a=0.05 at 95% confidence interval. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During critical data ascertainment, blank questionnaires, questionnaires 
  with more than three missing answers, and those where a positive answer was 
  given to the fictitious drug question were excluded from the analysis.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of total participants, there were 46.9% male and 48.7% female 
  students aged 13-15 years (36.1%), 16-18 years (30.0%), and 10-12 years (27.2%). 
  Only 4.4% were over 18. With regard to socioeconomic status, most belonged to 
  Class C (45.9%), followed by Class B (23.7%), Class A (11.5%), Class D (14.3%), 
  and a minority to Class E (1.4%). Of all, 3.2% did not provide information on 
  social class.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Psychoactive drugs mostly used in a lifetime 
  were: alcohol (68.9%), tobacco (22.7%), solvents (10.1%), marijuana (6.6%), 
  benzodiazepines (3.8%), amphetamines (2.6%), and cocaine (1.6%) (<a href="#tab">Table</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18462t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Students who used drugs in a lifetime showed higher school absence 
  (72.5%) than non-users (58.5%) (p&lt;0.05).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for sex, lifetime use of marijuana, cocaine, and solvents 
  was higher in male students and benzodiazepines in female students. The mostly 
  used benzodiazepine was Diazepam® (41.2%), followed by Lexotan®. Among most 
  commonly referred amphetamines were Inibex® and Hipofagin®. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There was no statistically significant difference in both sex 
  groups regarding other drugs, including tobacco and alcohol.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Comparison between public and private schools </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Besides differences associated with socioeconomic variables 
  between public and private school students, it was found that 16.6% of public 
  school students have ever used any drug (except tobacco and alcohol) and 2.4% 
  referred regular use. Drugs most commonly used were: alcohol (67.6%), tobacco 
  (22.2%), solvents (8.9%), marijuana (6.3%), benzodiazepines (3.5%), amphetamines 
  (2.2%), and cocaine (1.7%). Heavy use of marijuana was seen in 1.0%, followed 
  by solvents in 0.6%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In private schools, lifetime drug use was higher for all drugs 
  22.5% (p&lt;0.05), solvents, 16.9% (p&lt;0.05), amphetamines, 4.7% (p&lt;0.05). 
  There was no statistical significant difference for other drugs when compared 
  to public schools: alcohol (76.2%), tobacco (25.6%), marijuana (8.4%), benzodiazepines 
  (5.0%), and cocaine (1.2%). Of them 1.9% referred heavy use of solvents and 
  0.9% of marijuana.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In public schools, higher drug use was seen among students over 
  16, which could probably be due to more available resources since many public 
  school students at this age stated they had a job. In private schools, drug 
  use in the age group 16-18 was higher in all use patterns. In contrast, drug 
  use in the age group 10-12 was higher in public schools. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Male students used more drugs than female students. It is worth 
  noting there was found a clear female preference for licit drugs (prescription 
  drugs such as benzodiazepines and amphetamines) and male preference for illicit 
  drugs, which corroborates the trend identified in other studies (Bucher,<sup>2 
  </sup>1992; Galduróz et al,<sup>3</sup> 1997; Muza et al,<sup>4</sup> 1997; 
  Zilberman,<sup>5</sup> 1998). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A comparison between public and private schools showed a higher 
  prevalence of drug use in public schools, which could be associated to the students’ 
  higher social status and more availability of resources to buy drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Further conclusions are hindered due to the scarcity of epidemiological 
  studies in private schools since researchers do not have easy access to data 
  collection. (Bucher,<sup>2 </sup>1992).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Drug use seen in the schools of Assis is similar to that described 
  in CEBRID studies in the city of São Paulo (19% lifetime use) but it is slightly 
  lower than that found by the same authors in other Brazilian capitals (an average 
  of 24.7% lifetime use) (Galduróz et al,<sup>3</sup> 1997), and much lower than 
  that seen in developed countries (Muza et al<sup>4</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Psychoactive drug use has been ubiquitous in man history with 
  varying drugs, amounts and routes. A more marked use of a given drug at a time 
  suggests specific factors to that time in history. Thus, drug abuse is more 
  a symptom than the cause of problems in today’s society and for that it should 
  be tackled taking into account its complexity and magnitude. The most efficient 
  action to lessen the drug problem is to develop specific prevention policies 
  for each social stratum and age group focusing on health promotion and respect 
  for life. </font></p>
