<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To analyze maternal complications associated 
  to type of delivery, comparing cesarean (c-) section with vaginal delivery.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Retrospective study of 1,748 deliveries carried out at a university 
  hospital in the city of São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, in which the newborn 
  weighed more than 500 g. Maternal complications occurred during delivery as 
  well as those diagnosed during puerperium that required further hospital admission 
  were analyzed. Statistical analyses included Student’s <i>t </i>test and Fisher’s 
  Exact test. Significance level was set at 0.05.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>C-sections were performed on 988 patients (56.5%). Hemorrhagic 
  complications occurred in 1.2% of c-sections and in 0.8% of normal deliveries, 
  with no statistically significant difference between both groups. Endometritis 
  was observed in 0.4% of c-sections and in 0.1% of vaginal deliveries, without 
  statistically significant difference. Two cases of puerperal infection evolved 
  to hysterectomies, in the c-section group. There were no maternal deaths related 
  to c-section.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>No associations were found between maternal complications 
  and type of delivery in the period analyzed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the last few years, Brazil has had one of the highest rates 
  of caesarian (c-) section delivery worldwide. This is related to a number of 
  factors, which involve, mainly, recent improvements in surgical and anesthetic 
  techniques, greater availability of propaedeutic resources that detect risk 
  for the fetus, the increase in the incidence of pregnancies in patients with 
  prior c-sections, and sociocultural factors related to the greater practicality 
  of programmed delivery.<sup>11</sup> Obviously, any surgical procedure includes 
  a level of risk inherent to the act itself. However, the possibility of avoiding 
  a c-section in emergency situations, due to maternal or fetal risk, has stimulated 
  discussions, since certain circumstances suggest elective c-sections as an option 
  in the context of the dialog established between obstetrician and patient.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a study published in 1999, Belizán et al<sup>1</sup> (1999) 
  report a growing increase in c-section rates in a number of Latin-American countries, 
  especially Chile, with 40% and Brazil, with 27.1% (1994-96). However, according 
  to governmental statistics provided by the <i>Sistema de Informações dos Nascidos 
  Vivos</i> (Live-birth Information System - SINASC),<sup>9</sup> the c-section 
  rate in 2000 in the state of São Paulo was as high as 48.4%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In high-risk pregnancies, complications may frequently require 
  the premature interruption of gestation, producing an increase in c-section 
  rates. The present survey was conducted in an obstetrical clinic of a university 
  hospital. In a university environment, the procedures adopted tend to follow 
  pre-established protocols,<sup>17</sup> in which indications for surgical procedures 
  are based mainly on the clinical and obstetrical aspects of each case, in an 
  attempt to minimize c-section incidence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The greater morbidity associated with c-sections in comparison 
  with vaginal delivery is well documented in the literature.<sup>3,4,6,7</sup> 
  However, few studies describe in detail the types of complications associated 
  to the procedures. The present study is aimed at analyzing the different delivery-associated 
  complications, comparing c-section and vaginal delivery. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The survey was carried out in the obstetrical clinic of a university 
  hospital in the city of São Paulo, characterized by its status as a reference 
  center for severe cases, thus receiving a significant body of high-risk patients 
  with intercurrent clinical and obstetric conditions. The profile of this population 
  increases the risk of abnormal occurrences during pregnancy and labor, as well 
  as the risk of fetal suffering, thus increasing the proportion of c-sections. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Between 1 April and 31 December 2001, 2,410 patients were admitted 
  to the facility. Early in 2001 a computerized program designed to store in- 
  and outpatient personal and clinical data, including data related to the newborn, 
  was implemented in the clinic. Admission files in the patient’s medical records, 
  as well as delivery files and discharge reports were printed using this software. 
  In order to ensure the effective inclusion of all deliveries carried out in 
  this clinic, electronic datasheets were checked on a monthly basis, comparing 
  data from the software with the delivery registration journal, kept by the nursing 
  service of the obstetrics clinic. During the period analyzed, a total 1,748 
  deliveries were carried out in which the newborn weighed more than 500 g. Data 
  were analyzed retrospectively based on the institution’s database. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clinical diagnoses most frequently observed among 
  the population analyzed are presented in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. </font></p>
<p><a name="tab1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18446t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A large number of other diagnoses were observed with lesser 
  frequency. 357 pregnant women did not present intercurrent clinical or obstetric 
  conditions, or 20.4% of the analyzed population. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maternal age varied between 12 and 44 years, with mean age 27.6 
  years, 6.9 years standard deviation and 27.1 years median value. In terms of 
  obstetrical history, 694 were nulliparae, or 39.7% of cases. Antenatal care 
  was provided at the same health facility for 1,173 patients (67%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Due to its being a university hospital, most surgical procedures 
  in the institution are performed by resident trainee students, under direct 
  supervision of assistant doctors belonging to the department’s clinical team. 
  According to this classification, 1,706 deliveries were done by resident trainees, 
  or 97.6% of analyzed cases. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clinical and/or obstetrical indications for the 
  termination of gestation by c-section are listed in <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. 
  </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18446t2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The conditions listed in <a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> correspond to those considered to be the main indication for the c-section 
  in each case, even if more than one problem was diagnosed. The occurrence of 
  maternal complications in cases in which c-sections were performed was compared 
  to that of cases of vaginal delivery (normal or forceps). Complications studied 
  included those occurred during the surgical procedure, as well as those occurred 
  during puerperium that required rehospitalization. The infectious complication 
  investigated was puerperal infection, defined as the infection originated in 
  the genital apparatus after recent delivery. Endometritis was characterized 
  as an infection of the placental implantation site with concomitant fever and 
  pain, softening, and insufficient involution of the uterus, requiring treatment 
  with specific antibiotic therapy. Abdominal wall infection at the site of surgical 
  incision was only considered in this analysis in case there was the need for 
  rehospitalization for restitching purposes. Hemorrhagic consequences analyzed 
  included the occurrence of hypotonic myometrium or uterine atony in which excessive 
  bleeding and inefficient contractility of the uterus required supplementary 
  intravenous/ intramuscular oxytocin administration and uterine massage. Placenta 
  accreta was characterized when placental villi was attached to the myometrium, 
  with abnormally firm adherence to the uterine wall. In attempting at manual 
  detachment, partial or total absence of a cleavage was observed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quantitative variables were analyzed descriptively through the 
  observation of minimum and maximum values and mean, median, and standard deviation 
  calculations. For qualitative variables, absolute and relative frequencies were 
  calculated. Comparison of means was carried out using Student’s <i>t</i> test 
  for non-paired samples. Comparison of proportions was evaluated using Fisher’s 
  Exact Test. Significance level was set at 0.05 (a=5%). Hence, descriptive (p-) 
  levels below this threshold were considered as significant (p&lt;0.05).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the total 1,748 deliveries occurred in the 
  obstetrical unit in the studied period, c-sections were performed on 988 patients 
  (56,5%), whereas 760 patients (43.5%) underwent vaginal deliveries. Mean and 
  median maternal age values according to the type of delivery are presented in 
  <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. Mean age is significantly lower among the vaginal 
  delivery group. Patient age <u>&gt;</u>35 years was significantly associated 
  to c-section, which was performed on 62,9% of patients in this age group. No 
  significant differences in type of delivery were observed in terms of parity 
  and gestational age. Of the 1,274 cases of patients without prior c-sections, 
  690 (54.2%) had vaginal deliveries. Vaginal deliveries occurred in only 23.4% 
  (68 cases) of the 290 patients with a previous history of c-sections. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#tab4">Table 4</a> presents data referent 
  to the maternal complications observed, according to the type of delivery. There 
  were no statistically significant differences in terms of hemorrhagic or infectious 
  complications, both of which occurred only in a small proportion of cases. Uterine 
  atony and hypotonic myometrium were the most frequent among hemorrhagic complications. 
  However, they were not related to type of delivery. Among the cases that evolved 
  to hemorrhagic complications, seven required hysterectomy due to excessive bleeding, 
  six of which were from the c-section group. Other complications proper of each 
  type of procedure were also observed. The prolongation of hysterotomy is an 
  event observed only in c-section deliveries, whereas perineal lacerations are 
  proper of vaginal delivery. </font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18446t4.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No maternal deaths directly related to the analyzed obstetrical 
  procedure were observed during the present study. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The high incidence of c-sections (56.5%) in the facility investigated 
  reflects the large proportion (80%) of patients with intercurrent clinical and/or 
  obstetric conditions among its population. This limits the value of c-section 
  rate comparisons with low-risk populations. Yazlle et al,<sup>15</sup> in an 
  analysis of deliveries taken place between 1986 and 1995 in Ribeirão Preto report 
  a 48.4% c-section rate. Governmental statistics show a 48.4% c-section rate 
  for the state of São Paulo in 2000.<sup>9</sup> These levels are acknowledgedly 
  higher than those encountered in the US and Europe. Dobson<sup>5</sup> reports 
  rates as high as 21.5% in England and Wales in 2000. Rates in the US varied 
  between 21 and 22% in the 1989-98 period.<sup>4</sup> However, a high incidence 
  of c-sections in high-risk pregnancies is expected, and contributes towards 
  an increase in these rates in university hospitals,<sup>14</sup> to which more 
  severe cases are referred. Similarly, Turnbull et al<sup>13</sup> reported a 
  43.9% c-section rate among high-risk pregnancies in Adelaide, Australia, despite 
  the country’s 19.5% national rate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In high risk pregnancies, clinical or obstetric complications 
  often require gestation termination. In such cases, some particularities usually 
  prevent vaginal delivery. Preterm birth, which occurred in 26.6% of cases in 
  the present study, hinders the induction of labor, especially in cases in which 
  cervical maturation has not yet been achieved, thus promoting an increase in 
  the number of c-sections. Likewise, the induction of labor is not recommended 
  in the presence of uterine scars. Thus, iterative c-sections – when the patient 
  has a history of two or more previous c-sections – are frequent in Brazil. In 
  the present survey, of the patients that underwent c-section delivery, as many 
  as 40% had a history of prior c-sections. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mean maternal age was lower among pregnancies that progressed 
  to vaginal deliveries. Patients aged <u>&gt;</u>35 years also presented a higher 
  c-section rate. The occurrence of clinical abnormalities is known to be directly 
  proportional to age, often influencing the rate of c-sections. Bobrowski &amp; 
  Bottoms<sup>2</sup> (1995) found a relationship between maternal age and intercurrent 
  clinical conditions such as chronic arterial hypertension and diabetes. These 
  authors also described an important increase in c-section rates in &gt;35 years 
  nulliparae (48.5%). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An analysis of the incidence of c-section-related maternal complications 
  shows a greater absolute number of complications involving this procedure. However, 
  there was no significant association between complications and type of delivery; 
  it should also be noted that the frequency of each complication was low, with 
  values below 1%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Difficulties in the characterization of infectious complications 
  limit comparisons with other studies in the literature. The criteria applied 
  in different healthcare facilities for hysterectomy recommendation in cases 
  of puerperal infection are not uniform. Several factors may influence the option 
  for such a procedure, including age, parity, and desire for further gestations. 
  In a study of the occurrence of endometritis, Yokoe et al<sup>16</sup> (2001) 
  found 0.8% incidence of this infection after c-sections and 0.2% after vaginal 
  deliveries. Loverro et al<sup>6</sup> (2001), in an analysis of post-surgical 
  febrile morbidity, found that 5.14% of cases of c-section delivery presented 
  infectious complications characterized by fever on two consecutive days. This 
  proportion was significantly higher than that observed after vaginal delivery 
  (0.29%). However, the authors did not include specific data on endometritis. 
  Other studies, report greater endometritis rates of c-sections. Spinnato et 
  al<sup>12</sup> (2000) report endometritis in 4.7% of non-elective c-sections. 
  Mah et al<sup>8</sup> (2001), in an analysis of risk factors for infections 
  following surgical incision found this type of complication in 2.8% of c-sections, 
  and reported independent risk factors such as surgery duration and nonuse of 
  prophylactic antibiotic therapy. However, the authors again did not specifically 
  discriminate endometritis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the lack of statistical significance, the present survey 
  included two cases of hysterectomy due to puerperal post-c-section infection, 
  which might have been avoided if a vaginal delivery had been carried out. Such 
  situations are usually characterized by a high risk of maternal mortality, especially 
  when accompanied by generalized infection or septicemia. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An important effect of hemorrhagic complications is the need 
  for hysterectomy, since this procedure definitely impairs the patient’s reproductive 
  life. In the present study, hemorrhage-related hysterectomy was required for 
  less than 1% of cases. Few studies include in-depth analyses of the hemorrhagic 
  complications related to c-sections. Loverro et al<sup>6</sup> (2001) evaluated 
  blood loss during labor indirectly, through an analysis of the need for blood 
  transfusion during intra- and post-delivery periods. The authors found no statistically 
  significant differences in the percentage of cases requiring intra-delivery 
  blood transfusion, which ranged from 0.1% in vaginal deliveries to 0.4% in c-sections. 
  In the post-delivery period, a significantly higher proportion of transfused 
  patients was observed among c-section subjects (1.9%) when compared to the vaginal 
  delivery group (0.39%). Combs et al<sup>3</sup> (1991) reported 6.4% incidence 
  of hemorrhagic complications in 3,052 c-sections, characterized by &#8805;10 
  point hematocrit reductions or the need for blood transfusion. The authors also 
  analyzed 9,598 vaginal deliveries, finding 3.9% incidence of transfusions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Post-surgical morbidity in obstetrical procedures is influenced 
  by the circumstances in which these procedures take place. There were no cases 
  of c-section-related maternal death in the present sample. Lydon-Rochelle et 
  al<sup>7</sup> (2001) considered c-sections not as a risk factor for maternal 
  mortality, but as a marker for preexistent morbidity. Emergency c-sections, 
  as well as those indicated after the onset of labor involve conditions not always 
  adequate for the performance of surgical procedures. Time since membrane rupture, 
  number of pelvic examinations, chorioamnionitis, and intra-delivery fetal monitoring 
  are some of the factors that may increase post-delivery infection incidence. 
  Studies comparing elective and emergency c-sections and vaginal delivery may 
  aid in the analysis of complications related to these procedures. The information 
  provided to the couple must include, in a simple and objective way, the benefits 
  and risks of each type of delivery, with emphasis on the safety of each procedure 
  as well as its associated complications, so that the couple may make a conscious 
  decision concerning the type of delivery to be carried out.<sup>9,10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In conclusion, no significant associations between the occurrence 
  of maternal complications and type of delivery were observed during the analyzed 
  period. The continuity of research in this healthcare unit, along with further 
  studies in low-risk populations in the private and public healthcare sectors 
  pose new challenges that will aid in the evaluation of the risk of complications 
  de facto related to this surgical procedure.   </font></p>
