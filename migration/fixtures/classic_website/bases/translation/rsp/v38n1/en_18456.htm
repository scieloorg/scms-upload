<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To estimate the prevalence 
  of breastfeeding among teenage mothers (less than 20 years old) and adult mothers 
  of six-month-old children and to identify factors associated with weaning.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>This was a cross-sectional study by means of a structured questionnaire 
  applied in the home, of a sample of 237 teenage mothers and 239 adult mothers 
  living in the city of Montes Claros, Brazil, whose babies were six months old 
  at the time of the interview. To assess factors associated with weaning, univariate 
  and bivariate Mantel-Haenszel analyses and multiple logistic regression were 
  performed.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>The prevalence of breastfeeding for children aged 6 months was 
  71.3% among teenage mothers and 77.4% among adult mothers (crude OR=1.38; p=0.128). 
  After adjusting for control variables, the role of adolescence in weaning gained 
  importance. The factors associated with weaning were: marital status, activity 
  outside of the home after delivery (both of these showed interaction with adolescence), 
  difficulty in breastfeeding during the first few days after delivery and exclusive 
  breastfeeding at the time of hospital discharge.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The interactions with adolescence that were observed in 
  relation to weaning suggest that motherhood within this age group has peculiarities 
  that make it a matter for further investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"> <b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The World Health Organization (WHO)21 defines adolescence as 
  the period of life within the age range of 10 to 19 years. Teenagers represent 
  20 to 30% of the world’s population, a figure that has been increasing in the 
  urban regions of emerging countries. According to data from the Instituto Brasileiro 
  de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE – Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics),<sup>8</sup> 
  teenagers comprised 20.8% of the total population of Brazil in the year 2000, 
  20.4% in the State of Minas Gerais and 22.4% in the municipality of Montes Claros, 
  within the State of Minas Gerais. For most people, sexual activity begins during 
  adolescence.<sup>21</sup> Despite great social, scientific and cultural progress 
  over recent decades, it is still difficult for teenagers and their parents to 
  discuss the topic of sex and sexuality. On the other hand, this progress – plus 
  the reduction in the age of the menarche<sup>21</sup> – has been stimulating 
  teenagers to begin sexual activity early without, however, preparing them for 
  what it brings.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pregnancy among this age group is increasing. The official data 
  available from SINASC (Sistema de Informações sobre Nascidos Vivos),<sup>16</sup> 
  the information system for live births), relating to the years 1994 to 1999, 
  although subject to failures in its coverage, allow the annual rates of live 
  births per thousand teenage girls during this period to be calculated and followed 
  up. For the whole of Brazil it went from 30.4 to 42.5; in Minas Gerais, from 
  5.4 to 34.1; and in Montes Claros, from 12.0 to 39.4.Exclusive breastfeeding 
  provides the ideal food for the newborn up to the age of six months. Over recent 
  decades, after a period of decline that culminated at the beginning of the 1970s, 
  there has been an increase in natural breastfeeding practices.<sup>9</sup> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Epidemiological studies on morbidity-mortality among children 
  fed artificially, and the participation of entities such as WHO, UNICEF (the 
  United Nations Children’s Fund) and the International Baby Food Action Network 
  (IBFAN) in the promotion of breastfeeding, have had vital importance in increasing 
  breastfeeding rates.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to the IBGE, the municipality of Montes Claros had 
  306,947 inhabitants in 2000, 94.2% of whom were living within the urban zone. 
  The city is a center of attraction for the whole of the northern region of Minas 
  and even the south of the State of Bahia, including in relation to medical attendance. 
  According to SINASC,<sup>16</sup> more than 92% of the deliveries are done in 
  hospital.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amador et al,<sup>1</sup> in their literature review of 1992 
  regarding breastfeeding among teenagers and adults, showed that the proportion 
  of mothers exclusively breastfeeding was lower among teenagers. They also observed 
  that the frequency of complete termination of breastfeeding by the end of the 
  third month was also greater in this group. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, in a cohort of children 
  born in 1993,<sup>7</sup> the prevalence of breastfeeding when the child was 
  six months old was lower among teenage mothers than among adults. The mother’s 
  age remained as a risk factor for terminating breastfeeding, even after adjusting 
  for another ten socioeconomic, demographic and nutritional variables. However, 
  the general prevalence of breastfeeding at the age of six months was very low: 
  only 35.1%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the city of Montes Claros, the general prevalence of breastfeeding 
  when the child was six months old increased from 59.3% in 1993<sup>11</sup> 
  to 65.0% in 1996.<sup>4</sup> The present study had the objective of verifying 
  whether adolescence was associated with the prevalence of weaning by the sixth 
  month of the child’s life.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A cross-sectional study via sampling was performed using a structured 
  retrospective questionnaire applied in the homes of teenage and adult mothers 
  living in the city of Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, six months 
  after the delivery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A total sample size of 480 mothers (240 in each group) was calculated, 
  to enable odds ratios (OR) of greater than or equal to 1.75, with a of 5% and 
  statistical power of 80%, to be demonstrated as significant for weaning. The 
  sample was selected sequentially from the declarations of live births received 
  by the Municipal Health Department, in order of delivery date. The criterion 
  for inclusion in the sample was that the mothers should live within the urban 
  zone of Montes Claros. To reach the calculated number of 480 mothers, 692 addresses 
  were investigated. Of these, 212 were discarded for the following reasons: 114 
  mothers (53.8%) were not found; 71 (33.5%) had moved to an unknown location; 
  16 (7.5%) had the wrong address; 10 (4.7%) with nobody at home after two attempts; 
  and 1 (0.5%) with house demolished. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To avoid losses among the 480 addresses identified, the following 
  procedure was utilized: if the mother was not present or could not respond to 
  the interview at the time of the visit, the interviewer arranged another time 
  to come back; if the mother was at another address, the interviewer went there. 
  All the 480 mothers found at home agreed to participate in the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The interviews were performed by selected university students, 
  who underwent five full days of training for this. The modified questionnaire 
  model devised by Caldeira<sup>4</sup> (1998) was applied, which was tested in 
  advance, standardized and precoded in order to obtain the information needed 
  in relation to breastfeeding. It took an average of 15 minutes to apply the 
  questionnaire, and data collection was performed during the period from January 
  1 to June 30, 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the 480 mothers, four were excluded: two teenage mothers 
  and one adult mother because their children had died; and one teenage mother 
  because the child had been offered for adoption. The three deaths occurred during 
  the first month of life: two due to respiratory illnesses and one due to prematurity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Children were considered to be breastfed when they were exclusively 
  or partially receiving breast milk. They were considered not to be breastfed 
  when they were receiving no breast milk at the age of six months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the analysis of associations between the mother’s age category 
  (independent variable) and weaning (dependent variable), the control variables 
  considered were: the mother’s education level, conjugal life, cohabitation with 
  the partner, number of previous children, whether the mother had breastfed previously, 
  parity, activity outside of the home after the delivery, number of people living 
  in the home, prenatal attendance and number of consultations, desire to breastfeed, 
  guidance regarding breastfeeding during prenatal and postnatal periods, type 
  of delivery, length of time after delivery for breastfeeding to be started, 
  whether the mother was able to stay together with the child in the hospital, 
  type of feed being given to the child at the time of release from hospital, 
  difficulty in breastfeeding during the first few days, the child’s sex, low 
  birth weight (&lt;2500 g), and whether the child received any child development 
  attendance. The variable <i>income </i>could not be utilized because there were 
  48 replies of “I don’t know”. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The chi-squared test with one degree of freedom was applied 
  (c<sup>2</sup><sub>1df</sub>) when there was no restriction on its use. When 
  indicated, the Student t test for two averages coming from independent samples 
  and unequal variance was utilized. The Mann-Whitney test was utilized in cases 
  when normality could not be assumed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The intensity of the associations between the independent variables 
  studied and the dependent variable was measured by means of the odds ratio (OR). 
  The possible interactions between the independent variables were evaluated two-by-two 
  using the stratified Mantel-Haenszel analysis, by applying the homogeneity test 
  for the OR of the strata. The criterion for entering the multivariate logistic 
  model was that p&lt;0.25 for the OR in the univariate analysis or for the interactions 
  in the bivariate model.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the multivariate analysis, initially the model was tested 
  with all the selected interactions against one without interactions, using the 
  likelihood ration (LR) test. Having defined the initial model, the independent 
  variables were removed one-by-one, using the criterion of p&lt;0.05, except 
  if they were components of a no-discardable interaction. The adaptation of the 
  use of the logistic model was assessed by means of the goodness-of-fit test.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The analyses were done by means of the Stata&#153; 
  version 6.0 statistical package. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The present study had approval from the Research Ethics Committee 
  of Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros and the Research Ethics Committee 
  of Universidade Federal de São Paulo<b>.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> presents the characteristics 
  of the 476 mothers studied (237 teenage mothers and 239 adult mothers), according 
  to the age group. With regard to the personal and sociodemographic attributes 
  considered, the teenagers only did not differ from the adults in relation to 
  the number of people living in the home. With regard to the variables from the 
  prenatal period, the high coverage of attendance and the high frequency with 
  which the pregnant women were advised regarding breastfeeding were similar between 
  the two groups. The desire to breastfeed and the average number of consultations 
  was greater among the adults. During the perinatal and postnatal periods, a 
  large percentage of mothers were able to stay together their child in the hospital 
  and received postnatal guidance, without difference between the groups. However, 
  while the adults took longer to begin breastfeeding after delivery, the teenagers 
  had more difficulty in breastfeeding during the first few days. The percentage 
  of children receiving exclusive breastfeeding at the time of release from hospital 
  was similar between the groups, and these children did not differ in relation 
  to the characteristics evaluated. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With regard to the effect on weaning of each 
  category of the variable “mother’s activity outside of the home during the first 
  six months of her child’s life”, it was observed that only the category “just 
  studying” had an influence on weaning before the child reached 6 months of age, 
  which justifies the subsequent dichotomization done thus(<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="tab2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18456t2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the time of the interview, 117 mothers (24.6% 
  of the total) were exclusively breastfeeding, of whom 35 were teenagers (14.8% 
  of all teenagers) and 82 adults (34.3% of all adults), p&lt;0.001. With regard 
  to weaning by the time of the interview, 68 teenage mothers (28.7%) and 54 adult 
  mothers (22.6%) had already weaned their children. <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a> 
  shows the raw OR for the variables potentially associated with weaning, selected 
  by means of the criterion “p&lt;0.25”. The OR values for “mother’s age category”, 
  “conjugal life” and “type of activity outside the home after delivery” must 
  not be interpreted in the way they appear in this table, since the OR of their 
  strata displayed heterogeneous behavior in the bivariate analysis. </font></p>
<p><a name="tab3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18456t3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These latter interactions are presented in <a href="#tab4">Table 
  4</a>, in which it is seen that the “teenager” category of mother’s age had 
  an antagonistic effect on weaning, in relation to the “conjugal life” stratum, 
  and a synergic effect on weaning, in relation to the “type of activity outside 
  the home after delivery”.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18456t4.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#tab5">Table 5</a> shows the interactions 
  and variables that remained associated with weaning after performing multiple 
  logistic regression analysis. From the results, it is seen that: a) the effect 
  of adolescence on weaning varies according to the conjugal status (it is protective 
  among teenage mothers without conjugal life and harmful among those with conjugal 
  life); b) “just studying” as an activity after delivery and “difficulty in breastfeeding 
  during the first few days” have an effect that favors weaning; c) exclusive 
  breastfeeding at the time of release from hospital protects against weaning 
  before the child reaches six months of age.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18456t5.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With regard to the difficulties in breastfeeding during the 
  first few days, the difficulty most frequently reported by the 179 mothers who 
  had such difficulties was “problems with the nipples” (in 51 mothers, or 28.5%), 
  followed by &quot;pain&quot; in 40 (22.3%), &quot;cracks&quot; in 35 (19.5%), 
  “absence of milk” in 24 (13.4%), “mastitis” in eight (4.5%), and diverse other 
  reasons in 21 mothers (11.8%).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although in the present study no case of refusal to be interviewed 
  occurred, it was surprising that the mothers were not found at 114 of the addresses 
  appearing on the declarations of live births to mothers living in the city of 
  Montes Claros. When added to the other 98 addresses discarded for reasons that 
  were easier to understand, these amounted to 30.6% of the live birth occurrences 
  declared, the information that is transmitted to SINASC. Nonetheless, with regard 
  to education level, the mothers included in the study were similar to those 
  that were not included, thus leading to the belief that the results obtained 
  would also apply to the latter. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over recent decades, after a period of decline that culminated 
  at the beginning of the 1970s, there has been an increase in natural breastfeeding 
  practices.<sup>9</sup> The profile of breastfeeding in Brazil was defined from 
  the National Survey of Health and Nutrition compiled by the Ministry of Health 
  with support from UNICEF.<sup>10</sup> This showed that in 1989 61.0% of the 
  children were partially weaned at the age of six months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The prevalence of breastfeeding in Brazil in 
  the sixth month was found to be 59.8% in the National Survey on Demography and 
  Health, performed in 1996<a name="1nota"></a>.<a href="#nota1"><sup>*</sup></a> A study 
  by the Ministry of Health<a name="2nota"></a><a href="#nota1"><sup>**</sup></a> performed 
  in 1999 showed that 80.5% of Brazilians who lived in the state capitals and 
  the Federal District were breastfeeding up to the sixth month and that 13.6% 
  of the mothers interviewed were exclusively breastfeeding in the sixth month. 
  This was a result similar to the 10.0% found by Paz<sup>12</sup> in São Paulo 
  in 1999, but lower than the 24.6% obtained in the present study in 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A study performed by Leite &amp; Nunes,<sup>11</sup> with the 
  participation of UNICEF, to assess the health conditions of children in the 
  northern region of the State of Minas Gerais, in 1993, revealed that the prevalence 
  of breastfeeding was 59.3% at the age of six months, in the city of Montes Claros. 
  In 1996, in a study conducted by Caldeira, this figure rose to 65.0%.<sup>4</sup> 
  Comparing these results with those obtained in the present study (breastfeeding 
  prevalence of 74.4% at the age of six months in the same city, in 2000), it 
  can be seen that there was a notable increase in breastfeeding in Montes Claros 
  over the course of those years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Various factors (media, awareness campaigns, world breastfeeding 
  week and the Friend of the Child hospital initiative) must have contributed 
  towards this rise, but the role of interventions during prenatal attendance 
  has certainly already been demonstrated. Davies-Adetugbo et al<sup>5</sup> compared 
  a group of pregnant women to whom a breastfeeding promotion program was offered, 
  with another group without this intervention. They observed the number of mothers 
  who began breastfeeding immediately after delivery was greater in the group 
  with the intervention (32.0% vs. 6.0%). Four months after the delivery, 40.0% 
  of the mothers in the intervention group were still breastfeeding, versus 14.0% 
  of the mothers in the control group. Prenatal attendance with guidance on breastfeeding 
  was studied by Reifsnider &amp; Eckhart<sup>15</sup> among two groups of pregnant 
  women, one a control group and the other an experimental group that received 
  education regarding breastfeeding. This study showed that the group given guidance 
  presented a greater percentage of mothers who were still breastfeeding three 
  to four months after the delivery, in comparison with the control group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the present work, 95.2% of the mothers had prenatal attendance, 
  with an average of 5.5 consultations, and 88.7% were given guidance about breastfeeding 
  during their confinement. This high percentage of attendance must have contributed 
  positively to the maintenance of breastfeeding until the date of the interview.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Exclusive breastfeeding at the time of release from hospital, 
  which was found in 96.8% of the mothers interviewed, was shown to be an important 
  independent protection factor against weaning, both among teenage mothers and 
  among adults. This practice forms part of the recommendations of the National 
  Program for Encouraging Breastfeeding. High percentages like those obtained 
  in the present study are the result of the implementation of this program in 
  maternity hospitals, as shown by Rea.<sup>14</sup> This author also observed 
  an increase in the duration of breastfeeding among mothers who were exclusively 
  breastfeeding at the time of release from hospital.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Difficulty in breastfeeding during the first few days, which 
  occurred more frequently among teenage mothers in the present study, was shown 
  to be strongly associated with weaning, independent of other factors. This observation 
  leads to the belief that measures directed towards the period just after release 
  from hospital should be tried out, with the aim of maintaining breastfeeding, 
  whatever the mother’s age is. In a literature review, Bergman et al<sup>3</sup> 
  observed that the main difficulties in breastfeeding were &quot;sore nipples&quot;, 
  &quot;child that did not latch onto the breast&quot; and &quot;insufficient 
  milk production&quot;. These results are concordant with those found in the 
  present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The difference in the prevalence of breastfeeding at the age 
  of six months (71.3% among adolescent mothers and 77.4% among adult mothers) 
  did not reach statistical significance. It is possible that the present dissemination 
  of breastfeeding encouragement practices has brought these figures together, 
  because in a review by Amador et al<sup>1</sup> in 1992, they reported a greater 
  frequency of weaning among teenage mothers, in comparison with adult mothers. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results obtained here, however, suggest that motherhood 
  during adolescence has peculiarities that make it a special and complex matter 
  to study, going by the interactions observed within this age group alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conjugal status had differing influence on weaning among teenage 
  mothers. The univariate and bivariate analyses showed that, among teenage mothers, 
  the existence of conjugal life favored weaning, while the opposite occurred 
  without conjugal life. One explanation for this finding is what was proposed 
  by experts from the Pan-American Health Organization:<sup>12</sup> faced with 
  pregnancy and motherhood, teenagers have a lot of emotional turmoil, they are 
  incapable of imagining themselves performing the role of a mother, and they 
  have feelings of denial and isolation and that the father of the child has no 
  place in their lives. Fergusson &amp; Woodward,<sup>6</sup> studying breastfeeding, 
  observed that older women who were living with a partner breastfed for a longer 
  time, which is in agreement with the results found in the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The teenage mothers who said that studying was their only activity 
  after the delivery presented a greater proportion of weaning by the child’s 
  sixth month of life. Comparing this result with others in the literature, Arlotti 
  et al<sup>2</sup> also observed that returning to school diminished the prevalence 
  of breastfeeding. The possible explanation is that these women are studying 
  more, getting pregnant during periods of study and staying outside of the home 
  for long periods, and there is no provision for breastfeeding at the study locations. 
  According to data from the present survey, 104 mothers worked outside of the 
  home during the first six months of their children’s lives, and 75.9% of them 
  did not wean their infants. Thompson &amp; Bel,<sup>17</sup> in a qualitative 
  study that investigated factors that facilitate breastfeeding it the workplace, 
  suggested that breastfeeding and working may be compatible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, although prenatal assistance with guidance on breastfeeding<sup>14</sup> 
  and being able to stay together with the baby in the hospital<sup>20</sup> are 
  factors recognized to be protective against early weaning, the similarly high 
  exposure of teenage and adult mothers to such practices that was found in the 
  present study means that the difference in weaning observed between the two 
  categories can be explained by variables relating to the teenagers’ personal 
  characteristics (conjugal and study status). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In conclusion, the results have shown that prenatal attendance 
  with guidance on breastfeeding and the possibility for the mother to stay together 
  with the baby in the hospital were protective against early weaning, independent 
  of the mother’s age category (teenager or adult).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the existence of conjugal life and “just studying” 
  as the activity outside of the home during the child’s first six months of life 
  were only risk factors for weaning among teenage mothers. If future studies 
  that also utilize multivariate techniques confirm such results, the occurrence 
  of this phenomenon should become the subject of a qualitative investigation.
