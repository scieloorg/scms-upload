<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To investigate language, visual and hearing 
  function development among infants in a day-care center based on educators’ 
  assessments.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>One hundred and fifteen infants who attended a day-care center 
  at a university of state od São Paulo, Brazil, were assessed during the period 
  between 1998 and 2001. The “Protocol for Observation of Language, Visual and 
  Hearing Function Development,” containing a total of 39 standardized tests, 
  was utilized to assess infants from three to 12 months old. The protocol was 
  applied by trained educators, members of the day-care center staff. Statistical 
  analysis was carried out using Chi-square test or Fischer’s exact test at p&lt;0.05.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Infants showed different language development patterns as for 
  polysyllabic babbling and production of first words. For visual function, infants 
  showed a different pattern of imitation and initiation in gesture games and 
  following commands with gestures.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The day-care center setting is probably promoting a distinct 
  pattern of language, visual and hearing function development. Prevention in 
  day-care centers should aim at integrating education and health to achieve the 
  common purpose of child welfare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Infant education is the first phase of basic education and is 
  directed toward children from zero to six years of age. Day-care for infants 
  is a necessity, particularly in large urban centers. The peculiarities of this 
  age group require that education should carry out two indissociable and complementary 
  functions: to care for and educate infants and small children. Society has influenced 
  parents to place infants in educational institutions earlier on in life and 
  for longer periods of time. Despite the fact that precise information is lacking 
  as to the proportion of infants which go to day-care centers in the country 
  as a whole, it is estimated that 40% of these infants are attending educational 
  institutions.<sup>3,&nbsp;14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The integrated development of the child depends upon both care, 
  which involves the emotional dimension of growth, and biological aspects of 
  the body, such as: the quality of food and health care and the way in which 
  these are offered to the child. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Few instruments for screening early language and detecting disturbances 
  among infants are mentioned in the literature. In contrast, there are a large 
  number of studies that screen children aged three and older, but almost none 
  that study the first year of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, language acquisition occupies a central role in development 
  during the first few years of life. Thus, one would imagine that it would function 
  as a sensitive indicator of the general integrity of development. Screening 
  for language development is a reasonable means of evaluating <i>“integrity of 
  many neural subsystems, including hearing, central auditory processing, cognitive 
  development, motor function (articulation, praxis, upper extremity motor function), 
  vision, and central processing of visual information”.</i><sup>4 </sup>Children’s 
  difficulties in acquiring language according to normal patterns is almost always 
  an indication of some kind of subjacent problem with respect to development. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Language may occur by means of two channels: the auditory channel, 
  including speech and its comprehension and the visual channel, which is necessary 
  for reading and writing, for gesticulating and for Sign Language, utilized by 
  deaf people. Infants who hear make use of vocalization, hearing comprehension 
  and gesticulation in order to communicate with others (social visual communication). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to vision, it is acknowledged that it contributes a great 
  deal to child development, for it is a factor which motivates guides and controls 
  movements and actions. Visual development, as well as the development of other 
  functions of the organism, is permeated by factors related to neurological maturation 
  and learning. It is determined by genetic factors and influenced by environmental 
  factors.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most important modifications in child development happen 
  during the first year of life, when progress occurs in great leaps within shorter 
  periods of time. Thus, in their reciprocal relationship within development, 
  the transformations in the axial and appendicular motor abilities, which happen 
  throughout the first year of life, contribute toward the refinement of visual 
  capabilities.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The health professional frequently overestimates children’s 
  capabilities in the development of language. This fact becomes clear when we 
  take into consideration the small number of children up to 3 years of age which 
  are counseled to seek language evaluation. It is estimated that approximately 
  2 to 3% of the children in this age group present some kind of delay in language 
  development, excluding those with mental retardation, cerebral palsy and deafness.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Prevention and early detection of alterations in infantile development 
  are procedures that are rarely applied in Brazil. Considering sensorial deficiencies 
  in particular, concern with respect to prevention and early detection are justified 
  by the possibility of anticipating the process of intervention towards the beginning 
  of the child’s life, guaranteeing the necessary stimulation in all aspects fundamental 
  to its global development. Within this area, screening procedures are utilized 
  for they are characterized as low cost instruments which are efficient and easy 
  to apply. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate language, 
  visual and hearing function development among infants attending at a day-care 
  center during their first year of life. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One hundred and fifteen infants attending a day-care center 
  for health care professionals working at a university in the State of Sao Paulo, 
  sons and daughters of employees of this university who worked in shifts in the 
  period between 1998 and 2001 were evaluated. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 115 infants were divided in three groups according to age 
  groups:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Group 1: 43 infants aged 3 months and 16 days to 6 months and 
  15 days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Group 2: 46 infants aged 6 months and 16 days to 9 months and 
  15 days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Group 3: 26 infants aged 9 months and 16 days to 12 months and 
  15 days. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Assessment was conducted by means of the “Protocol for Observation 
  of Language, Visual and Hearing Function Development,” consisting of 39 standardized 
  tests, 10 of which are associated with language, 11 are designed to test the 
  hearing function and 18 the social visual function. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The standardized tests of language, visual and hearing function 
  development within the Protocol were selected by Lima<sup>8</sup> from the “Early 
  Language Milestone Scale” while others were selected by Gagliardo<sup>6</sup> 
  from the “Bayley Scales of Infant Development”.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Considering that it was necessary to conduct the evaluation 
  during a period of the day when the child was feeling at ease, engaged in daily, 
  routine activities, among people who were familiar to him, the teachers of the 
  day-care center responsible for caring for the infants, were trained to apply 
  the tests and learned to observe the phases of development of each child. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some items of the Protocol could be observed during informal 
  interaction, while the infants were involved in activities carried out regularly 
  in the day-care center or could be directly tested, as occurred with the tests 
  undertaken to locate the sound of a bell on one of the sides or in the test 
  which called for students to imitate gesture games. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The parents of the infants who were assessed 
  signed a consent form when they registered their children in the day-care-center 
  according to which they permitted their children to undergo routine assessments. 
  Since this project has been incorporated into the infants’ evaluation system, 
  there was no need for a specific Informed Consent Form for this research<a name="1nota"></a>.<a href="#nota"><sup>*</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The training program, administered to educators of the day-care-center 
  in order to prepare them to apply the Protocol, consisted of five phases:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>First Phase:</b> In 1998, a meeting was held 
  by one of the authors of the Protocol, a speech therapist, with the team of 
  educators of the day-care-center “Area de Saúde” &#91;Health Field&#93;, in 
  order to inform and sensitize them with respect to the issues of language disturbances, 
  auditory and visual problems. The significance of screening was discussed as 
  well as the justification for undertaking this procedure. A member of the day-care-center 
  staff, a pedagogue who was very familiar with the tests that were going to be 
  applied, was chosen to teach her co-workers how to apply the Protocol. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Second Phase:</b> The Protocol was demonstrated 
  to the above mentioned pedagogue. The best place in the day-care-center to apply 
  the Protocol was then chosen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Third Phase:</b> The pedagogue trained members 
  of the day-care staff responsible for caring for the infants to administer the 
  Protocol. Each test in the Protocol was demonstrated and the day-care workers 
  were advised on how to apply each of them on infants within several age groups. 
  Planning was undertaken so as to integrate these preventive measures into the 
  educational program of the day-care-center. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fourth Phase:</b> The Protocol was administered 
  by the day-care staff, without the supervision of the pedagogue, but utilizing 
  the practical and theoretical orientations which they had received from her. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fifth Phase:</b> In order to certify that 
  the staff had registered the results of the tests adequately, the authors of 
  the Protocol assessed the training they had undergone. A random sample of infants 
  who had been submitted to screening by the day-care staff was re-assessed by 
  the authors of the Protocol and by the pedagogue. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The descriptive analysis of the data was undertaken utilizing 
  the “Epidemiological Information 6.0” Program (Epi Info). Variables of interest 
  within the study were compare3d by means of the Chi-Square or Exact Fischer 
  tests, when necessary adopting 5% level of significance. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Infant educators of the day-care center assessed 115 infants, 
  subdivided in age groups ranging from three months and 15 days to 12 months 
  and 15 days. Despite the fact that the Protocol is designed to screen infants 
  one month old, in the present study only infants more than three months old 
  were considered, for this is the age at which they begin to go to the day-care-center.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results of the ELM<sup>4</sup> Scale tests 
  for Group 1 are presented in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18459t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This group was also submitted to tests from the BAYLEY Scales:<sup> 
  2</sup> lifts the hand towards the object, which was accomplished by 41 (95.3%) 
  infants and hold an object in each hand, accomplished by 26 (60.5%) infants. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Group II the results of the ELM<sup>4</sup>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, infants were submitted to the BAYLEY<sup>2 </sup>Scales 
  test, transfer the object from one hand to the other, which was accomplished 
  by 35 (85.4%) of them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results of the ELM<sup>4</sup> Scale tests 
  for Group 3 are presented in <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18459t3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The BAYLEY<sup>2</sup> Scales tests to which the group was submitted 
  were: opposing thumb and forefinger in a pincer grip and placing one cube on 
  top of another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The prehension thumb/index finger test was accomplished by 10(38.5%) 
  of the infants. The test which involved placing one cube on top of another one 
  was accomplished by 5 (19.2%) of the infants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to verify the administration of the tests by the day-care 
  educators, the authors re-assesses a random sample of 5 infants from submitted 
  to screening each year between 1998 and 2001. The assessments corresponded in 
  100% of the evaluations undertaken by the educators. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ten of the sixteen tests to which infants in the three Groups 
  were submitted were accomplished within the expected age group. These were: 
  produces simple syllables, locates a lateral sound, locates a sound on the diagonal, 
  inhibits to “no”, visual tracking, blinks to threat, points to desired objects. 
  The six remaining tests (bubbles, repeating syllables, says mama and papa, produces 
  the first word, imitates, initiates gestures games) presented statistically 
  significant results when compared to previous studies, particularly those of 
  Lima<sup>8,9,10</sup> (1997), Coplan<sup>4</sup> (1983), Azevedo<sup>1</sup> 
  (1995) and Gogliardo.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A different pattern of language development was observed among 
  the infants with respect to the production of polysyllabic babbling and the 
  first words. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Furthermore, a reduced number of children imitated others and 
  produced spontaneous games involving social gesticulation, which indicates that, 
  although no evidence was found that there was a modification in language development 
  (oral and expressive), the environment of the day-care-center probably propitiates 
  conditions for a different pattern of development than that described by other 
  authors<sup>5,8,10,12</sup> who studied infants which spent most of their time 
  with one caregiver, usually the mother in one to one interaction. Another element 
  that should be taken into consideration is the quantity of visual and auditory 
  stimulants that are found in a collective environment, like a day-care-center. 
  Perhaps language development among infants does not follow a universal pattern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Auditory assessment, by testing infants’ response to auditory 
  stimuli, detected disabilities in two infants, which was confirmed by the presence 
  of otitis media.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Group 1 (see <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>) 
  when the test “making bubbles” was administered at six months, a smaller number 
  of infants were able to do so when compared to Lima’s study<sup>8</sup> in which 
  all infants the same age were able to make bubbles. Coplan<sup>4</sup> found 
  that most infants in his study produced lip vibrations in the middle of their 
  first year of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to the visual function tests, “visual tracking and blinks 
  to threat”, in Group 1 the responses obtained corresponded to findings in the 
  literature <sup>4,7,11</sup>, that is, these are behaviors presented by the 
  majority of infants studied at 4 months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The tests which involved locating a bell placed at a lateral 
  position, to the right and to the left were successfully performed by all infants, 
  corresponding to findings in the literature. From three months on, responses 
  emerge, such as searching for the source of a sound and lateral localization 
  on the same plane as the ear, which characterize an evolution in responses as 
  a result of the development of the Central Nervous System. <sup>1,4,12</sup> 
  One child did not localize the bell to her left which was explained by the presence 
  of Otitis Media, diagnosed by an ear, nose and throat specialist to whom he/she 
  was indicated by the day-care-center for evaluation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Group 2, <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, the 
  infants who were submitted to tests associated to language, that is, when they 
  begin to produce the simple syllable (monosyllabic babbling) and to repeat the 
  same syllables (polysyllabic babbling), performed below the expected level for 
  their chronological age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, by analyzing the results month by month, it was observed 
  that five infants did not produce simple monosyllables at seven months, one 
  infant at eight months and another one at nine months, being that the latter 
  was a child presenting recurrent Otitis Media. It should be noted that monosyllabic 
  babbling occurred, in fact, within the same age group as the group studied by 
  Lima, <sup>8,10</sup> for the majority was babbling simple syllables at eight 
  months. Coplan<sup>4</sup> found that monosyllabic babbling was produced among 
  infants who were over eight months old.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to polysyllabic babbling, 25 (54.3%) infants did not repeat 
  the same syllable until they were nine months old, a proportion much smaller 
  than that found in Lima’s, <sup>8,10</sup> investigation, wherein 100% of the 
  infants were producing polysyllabic babbling at nine months and in Coplan’s<sup>4</sup> 
  study, in which 75% of the infants were performing this test at the same period. 
  This number was maintained among the 15 infants who had completed the ninth 
  month, for only eight (53.4%) of them emitted polysyllabic babbling. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to imitates gesture games, 19 (41.3%) of the children in 
  the day-care-center were performing this test until they were nine months old. 
  On the other hand, the majority of the infants studied by Lima <sup>8,10</sup> 
  were performing this test at nine months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both the tests mentioned in which there were significant differences 
  between this and other studies, production of polysyllabic babbling and imitation 
  of gesture games, depend upon stimulation and perhaps a greater amount of interaction 
  between an adult and the baby. Rubino<sup>14</sup> states that, from the moment 
  in which the baby is capable of vocalizing sounds with characteristics similar 
  to those of adult speech, the mother begins to repeat the sounds made by infants. 
  The mother reflects the image of his vocal gesticulations back to the child. 
  Furthermore, she begins to interpret the child’s vocal productions. The fact 
  that an adult is not performing this activity with the infant may lead to this 
  differentiated development presented by infants at the day-care-center, with 
  a smaller number of them performing polysyllabic babbling at nine months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A similar situation occurred with respect to games involving 
  the imitation of gesticulations. Probably the fact that the infant does not 
  have an adult who is close to him available to play games involving the imitation 
  of gestures such as clapping one’s hands and blowing kisses leads to the emergence 
  of this behavior at a later period than that found in previous studies.<sup>4,8,9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The infants presented consistent replies with respect to auditory 
  stimuli, that is, locating a bell in an indirect manner, which is compatible 
  with other references from the literature.<sup>1, 12</sup> At eight months all 
  the children were capable of locating sounds situated below or above ear level, 
  indirectly.<sup>1</sup> One of the children did not respond to the bell, but 
  later it was verified that she/he had Otitis. The responses to the test “becomes 
  inhibited when confronted with a ‘no’”, that is, initial comprehension of a 
  simple command, were compatible with Lima’s,<sup>8</sup> findings, according 
  to which, the majority of infants investigated understood a “no” at nine months. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In group three, it may be observed (see <a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>) that, as to the use of expressive language, 14 (53.8%) infants were saying 
  mama/papa and 10(38.5%) were saying their first word. Performance with respect 
  to this last test was worse among these infants than among those in Lima’s study, 
  75.6% of who were emitting their first word at 12 months. Among the five infants 
  who had completed 12 months, none had yet emitted their first word. Coplan<sup>4</sup> 
  found that 70% of the infants emitting their first word at 12 months. It would 
  be expected that more than half of the infants, even in a situation in which 
  they are imitating the word enunciated by an adult, would incorporate part of 
  this enunciation, with the modifications appropriate for his own level of development. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the tests related to sound reception, that is, locating the 
  bell directly below them, 100% of the infants were performing the test, in conformity 
  with data from other studies.<sup>1,8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The test, “initiates game involving gesticulations” was performed 
  by 15 (57.7%) infants, a proportion that was lower than that reported by Coplan<sup>4</sup> 
  and Lima,<sup>8</sup> in which the majority of infants performed this test at 
  11 months. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The test “points to desired objects” was performed by 14(53.8%) 
  infants, a proportion greater than that found by Lima,<sup>8,9</sup> which was 
  35.6%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Educators at the day care center who participated in this research 
  acquired knowledge concerning the process of development as well as prevention 
  and detection of developmental disabilities, particularly those involving auditory 
  and visual functions, within the area of infantile education. This implied in 
  an investment in the education of the day-care-center’s caretakers. An integration 
  of the areas of health and education was required so as to accompany the infants’ 
  language development, particularly with respect to auditory and visual functions. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In conclusion, a reduced number of children performed certain 
  tests related to language development. However, no evidence was found of developmental 
  disabilities among these infants. Most probably, the day-care-center environment 
  is propitiating conditions for a different pattern of language development that 
  does not follow the universal pattern.   </font></p>
