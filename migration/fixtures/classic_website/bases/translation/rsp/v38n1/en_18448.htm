<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To assess the risk factors for small-for-gestational-age 
  (SGA) births.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>All live births occurring in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, between 
  October and December 1993 were identified and mothers interviewed soon after 
  delivery. Birthweight was recorded by the maternity staff. Gestational age was 
  obtained from the mothers’ recall of their date of last menstrual period. SGA 
  was defined as a birthweight below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational 
  age and sex, according to the reference developed by Williams. Chi-square test 
  and logistic regression were used in the crude and multivariate analysis, respectively.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>In all, 1082 births were identified. The prevalence of SGA was 
  13.1%. Even after adjusting for possible confounding variables, the odds ratio 
  for SGA among those infants whose family income was &lt;1 minimum wage was 8.81 
  (95% CI, 1.12-69.46) times higher than among those for infants with a family 
  income <u>&gt;</u>10 minimum wages. Low quality antenatal care was associated 
  with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% CI, 1.09 - 9.91) for SGA. Short maternal stature 
  and maternal smoking during pregnancy were also associated with SGA births.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Low socioeconomic status, maternal smoking during pregnancy, 
  maternal height and low quality antenatal care are the main risk factors for 
  SGA births.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Birth weight is a strong predictive factor for perinatal morbidity 
  and mortality. Low birth weight infants, that is, those born with &lt;2,500 
  g, present a higher mortality rate in the first weeks of life than those born 
  with <u>&gt;</u>2,500 g. Low birth weight may be due to prematurity, retarded 
  intrauterine growth or a combination of both factors. Each of these factors 
  present different etiologies and consequences.<sup>8,9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The majority of definitions consider as small-for-gestational-age 
  (SGA) those infants whose birth weights are below a specific cut-off point for 
  sex and gestational age. Other authors consider as SGA those infants born at 
  term, but whose weight at birth is <u>&lt;</u>2,500 g. Being SGA is utilized as an indicator 
  of retarded intrauterine growth, but these terms are not synonyms for some infants 
  considered SGA may simply be those located at the lower end of the normal curve 
  of fetal growth distribution, for example, sons and daughters of short mothers. 
  Infants exposed to agents that restrict intrauterine growth, such as cigarette 
  smoking during gestation, may have a lower birth weight than they would have 
  had if they hadn’t been exposed to this agent, but not sufficient to be considered 
  SGA. It is impossible to determine if an infant who is SGA did or didn’t suffer 
  from intrauterine growth retardation based on a simple evaluation of fetal size 
  and gestational age.<sup>1</sup> On the other hand, the larger the prevalence 
  of SGA infants, the greater the proportion of intrauterine growth retardation. 
  At present, the World Health Organization<sup>15</sup> recommends that those 
  infants with birth weights below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational 
  age and sex, according to the reference developed by Williams’<sup>14</sup> 
  should be considered SGA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Infants born SGA present an increased morbidity and mortality 
  rate for the first years of life.<sup>2,4,6,10</sup> Furthermore, as suggested 
  in the studies edited by Barker et al,<sup>3</sup> these infants present a higher 
  risk for developing chronic illnesses as adults, such as diabetes, hypertension 
  and coronary disease. Consequently, preventing the birth of infants who are 
  small-for-gestational-age will have short and long run effects. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to the etiology of SGA, the main risk factors are: black 
  race; low caloric intake or low weight gain during gestation, low pre-gestational 
  weight, maternal smoking, and short maternal stature.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The objective of this study is to identify the main risk factors 
  for small-for gestational-age births and collaborate towards the implementation 
  of measures that result in a reduction in the prevalence of this pathology.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A cross-sectional study in which women that had given birth 
  between October and December, 1996, in the five maternities of the city of Pelotas 
  in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil were invited to participate. Initially, the 
  study’s objectives were explained to mothers who were then asked to give their 
  informed consent. Those who participated in the study, a total of 1,082 mothers, 
  were interviewed. The standardized questionnaire utilized for the interview 
  included questions concerning socioeconomic as well as demographic conditions, 
  reproductive history, maternal smoking during gestation, antenatal care and 
  birth assistance. The maternities were visited daily in the mornings and afternoons 
  by interviewers. The latter were medical students, previously trained in techniques 
  for applying questionnaires. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Birth weight was measured by assistants working in the nursery 
  wards. Gestational age was calculated by subtracting the date of the last menstruation 
  from the date of birth. Those children whose birth weight, according to gestational 
  age and sex, was below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, according to the reference 
  developed by Williams,<sup>14</sup> were considered SGA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to quantify antenatal care, an indicator developed 
  by Kessner and adapted by Takeda<sup>12</sup> which combines the number of visits 
  to the antenatal clinic and the period in which antenatal care was initiated 
  was utilized. When the mother attended 5 or more antenatal visits and the first 
  visit occurred up to the fourth month of gestation, antenatal care was considered 
  adequate. Antenatal care was classified as inadequate when mothers attended 
  antenatal clinics less than four times and initiated care after the seventh 
  month of gestation. Antenatal care was classified as intermediate in all the 
  remaining cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to the Kessner index, quality of care was measured 
  according to a score that was created based on procedures performed during the 
  antenatal visit. Mothers were asked were asked whether the doctor had weighed 
  her, measured her blood pressure, auscultated fetal heartbeats, measured uterine 
  fundal height. Furthermore, mothers were asked whether in, any of the visits, 
  the physician examined the breasts, encouraged breastfeeding, prescribed iron 
  and tetanus toxoid, performed a gynecological examination and whether the latter 
  included a Pap smear. Each item performed was given a score of 1. Consequently, 
  scores varied from 0 to 8, indicating, respectively, antenatal care in which 
  none of the above items were performed or antenatal care in which all of the 
  above items were performed according to mothers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to maternal smoking, in order to ensure the quality of the 
  information being collected, mothers were asked about their smoking habits during 
  pregnancy. Those who stated they smoked during pregnancy were asked about their 
  smoking habits during each trimester as well as the number of cigarettes smoked 
  daily. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A data bank was created utilizing the Epi Info program. The 
  Chi-Square test was performed on bivariate analysis with the objective of describing 
  the occurrence of SGA, taking the independent variables and possible confounding 
  factors into consideration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the logistic regression, the SPSS Program was utilized to 
  analyze data hierarchically: socioeconomic and demographic variables were included 
  in the first level; in the second level, anthropometric variables (height and 
  corporal mass) were included; reproductive variables were in the third level; 
  in the fourth level were maternal smoking variables; and in the fifth level 
  were those variables related to antenatal care. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the hierarchical model, each set of variables of a specific 
  level were included. A retrospective selection was undertaken and all variables 
  with p <u>&gt;</u>0.25 were eliminated. In this type of model, variables situated 
  in a higher hierarchical level than the variable being analyzed are considered 
  potential confounding factors of the relation between this variable and the 
  outcome of the study. The variables situated in lower levels are considered 
  potential mediators of the effect of the exposure being studied. The variables 
  selected in a particular level were retained in the subsequent models and were 
  considered as risk factors for SGA, even if, with the inclusion of hierarchically 
  inferior variables, they had lost their significance. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a result of the 1,082 interviews conducted with mothers, 
  911 infants were included in the study and the remaining 171 were excluded for 
  it was not possible to obtain information concerning their birth weight and 
  gestational age. The prevalence of SGA within the study group was 13.1%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> indicates that the 
  prevalence of SGA was higher among those infants whose parents had low income 
  or low educational level. <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a> indicates that low maternal 
  stature (<u>&lt;</u>150 cm) was associated with a higher prevalence of infants with SGA 
  &#91;odds ratio; 2.88 (95% CI 1.35-6.15)&#93;. On the other hand, parity, sex 
  of the newborn and previous stillborn were not associated with SGA. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the multivariate analysis (see <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n1/en_18448f1.gif">Figure</a>), 
  the variables entered the regression model according to the hierarchical theoretical 
  model, previously discussed. In the first set, the marital status of the mother, 
  maternal age and family income remained in the model, and the latter was the 
  variable most strongly associated with SGA. Even after adjusting for socioeconomic 
  and demographic variables, the chance of an infant being SGA was 2.3 (CI 95% 
  1.07-5.07) times greater among infants whose mothers’ height was <u>&lt;</u>150 cm than 
  among infants whose mothers’ height was <u>&gt;</u>160 cm. The children whose 
  mothers smoked during pregnancy also continued to present a greater chance of 
  being SGA. Mothers with poor quality antenatal care continued to present a greater 
  chance of having a SGA child as well. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This study encompassed almost all births which occurred in hospitals 
  in the city of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, in southern Brazil, during 
  a three month period in the year 1996, thus reducing the possibility of a selection 
  bias. On the other hand, gestational age was estimated utilizing the date of 
  the last menstruation as a parameter, which led to the exclusion of some mothers 
  who did not remember this date. Mothers who do not remember this date present 
  a greater prevalence of low birth weight and belong to a lower socioeconomic 
  status.<sup>5</sup> Consequently, the prevalence of SGA is underestimated in 
  this study. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As to the effect of socioeconomic status on intrauterine growth, 
  low socioeconomic status is associated to smoking, poor nutritional state and 
  other factors which are considered determinants of intrauterine growth. In this 
  study, even after adjusting for the variables situated in the lower hierarchical 
  levels, the children from low income families continued to present a greater 
  chance of being SGA. This is probably a consequence of not including some of 
  the possible mediators of the effects of low socioeconomic status, such as infections 
  during pregnancy and the drug abuse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In our study, low maternal stature was associated with the birth 
  of SGA infants, in consonance with the literature.<sup>9,11</sup> Since this 
  association was observed even after adjustment for confusion by socioeconomic 
  status and pre-gestational weight, it is probably due to a genetic effect or 
  is adaptive to the environmental conditions in the uterus. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it has been observed in other studies<sup>9,11</sup> maternal 
  smoking during pregnancy increases the infants’ risk for SGA, in a direct dose-response 
  relation, in which an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked during gestation 
  increases the risk of SGA newborns. Maternal smoking may effect intrauterine 
  growth in at least three different ways: fetal hypoxia due to increased levels 
  of carboxyhemoglobulin; uterine vasoconstriction and interference in fetal metabolism.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Theoretically, antenatal care should have a beneficial impact 
  on intrauterine growth, for it makes it possible to identify and to treat complications 
  during gestation and to eliminate or reduce modifiable risk factors, such as, 
  for example, the habit of smoking. Evidence of the repercussion of antenatal 
  care on the conditions of birth are weak, since the majority of studies failed 
  to establish criteria capable of evaluating the quality of antenatal care. A 
  reduced number of visits would be associated to poor quality antenatal care. 
  For this reason, it would be interesting if the estimates were adjusted to the 
  number of antenatal visits.<sup>12 </sup>The Kessner index evaluates adequacy, 
  but not quality. The creation of a score related to the content of the visits 
  is an attempt to objectify this process and is one more criteria for evaluating 
  quality. Halpern et al<sup>7</sup> demonstrated that, despite the high antenatal 
  coverage in the municipality of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, there are 
  inequities in the care pregnant women receive. Since the association between 
  poor quality antenatal care and births of SGA infants was observed in this study, 
  even after controlling for the number of antenatal visits, the effect of quality 
  is independent of the number of antenatal visits during gestation, suggesting 
  that, in addition to stimulating an increase in the number of visits, an increase 
  in the quality of antenatal care should be sought.   </font></p>
