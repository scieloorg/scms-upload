<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To evaluate the results of systematizing preventive and health promotion 
  actions among phenylketonuria (PKU) patients.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Results of phenylketonuria patients attended in the Prenatal 
  PKU Screening Program in the State of Paran&aacute;, Brazil, from 1996 to 2001, 
  were evaluated. Socioeconomic data were investigated and the gross motor function 
  measure was applied to determine the motor score among 32 PKU infants with early 
  diagnosis and treatment. Pearson's correlation coefficient was adopted to investigate 
  the relationship between the target variable (motor score) and other quantitative 
  variables (mean post-treatment serum phenylalanine level, parents' educational 
  level, infant's age at the start of treatment, and family income).<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Among all the children evaluated, 93.7% showed development within 
  normal limits as reported in the literature. Treatment was initiated in the 
  first month of life in 71.9% of the PKU cases. Socioeconomic data showed 39.5% 
  of parents having completed the fourth grade of primary school or less. There 
  was a significant correlation between infant's motor score and parents' educational 
  level (N=32), as well as between motor score and early treatment (N=27).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The results highlighted the program's effectiveness. The 
  correlation between parents' low educational level and lower motor score emphasizes 
  the importance of support for parents in their use of diet therapy. The association 
  between motor score and early initiation of treatment confirms the need for 
  immediate admission into the program. The paucity of other evaluation studies 
  in the literature makes generalization of the results difficult.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">PKU is an 
  autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the mutation of a gene located in 
  chromosome 12q22-24.1,<sup>7</sup> causing liver deficiency of phenylalanine-hydroxylase, 
  leading to reduced conversion of phenylalanine (PA) to tyrosine and a resulting 
  increase in serum PA. Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), the generic term for increased 
  serum PA, can be found in two different basic types: classical PKU with PA &gt;10 
  mg/dl, and persistent hyperphenylalaninemia, with PA &gt;4 mg/dl.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">PKU is caused 
  by the child's inability to use the amino acid phenylalanine. Early diagnosis 
  and treatment of PA disorders are crucial to avoid brain damage and thus to 
  prevent mental disability and motor and behavioral disorders, epilepsy, and 
  stunting, among others.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reference 
  plan for the limits between health and disease in PKU is basically identified 
  by normal cognitive and motor development of the treated child. Early diagnosis 
  is the first step, and diet therapy is initiated in the first weeks of life 
  and extends throughout the lives of individuals with PKU. Many factors influence 
  PKU treatment, and the encouragement of immediate and continuing diet adherence 
  requires family support and an ongoing educational process, both for the parents 
  and the health professionals dealing with the child. Various factors can lead 
  to discontinuity of treatment: social pressures hindering social integration 
  of individuals with PKU; financial constraints due to the high cost of special 
  foods; lack of knowledge of PA levels in foods; lack of food products with reduced 
  PA levels that meet nutritional needs; and lack of knowledge of the diet and 
  its implications for the disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  of a PKU treatment program hinge on multiple and complex interactions between 
  the program's implementation (technology, training, materials, funding, and 
  technical assistance) and institutional factors. Transparency of results as 
  demonstrated by evaluation studies can be a facilitating factor for immediate 
  treatment adherence in new cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Donabedian (1997),<sup>3</sup> an evaluation of the outcomes achieved by 
  health services should reflect the effects of all health care inputs and can 
  thus serve as an indicator for indirect quality evaluation of both the structure 
  and the process.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The state 
  of Paran&aacute; has been conducting neonatal screening for PKU and congenital 
  hypothyroidism (HC) since 1987, where the neonatal screening program's main 
  objective is early detection, allowing for timely treatment and follow-up of 
  cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Blood samples 
  obtained in maternity hospitals and wards statewide are referred to the FEPE's 
  Research Center Laboratory (CEPE). Developed in partnership with the Unified 
  National Health System (SUS), this initiative was the precursor for the screening 
  program, which covers not only diagnosis but also treatment of PKU children. 
  In 1996, FEPE set up a multidisciplinary team for diagnosis, laboratory follow-up, 
  and treatment of these children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Paran&aacute; 
  Association of PKU and Homocystinuria (HCU) Patients AFEH-PR was founded in 
  1992 to provide support to local PKU and HCU children and their parents. Based 
  in the city of Curitiba, FEPE and AFEH-PR has created a link between the State 
  and the community and are in charge of monitoring health of PKU patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study has the purpose of evaluating the results of systematizing preventive 
  and health promotion activities for PKU patients.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
  studied a total of 32 children treated early by the Paran&aacute; State Neonatal 
  Screening Program from 1996 to 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Paran&aacute; 
  program cares for 115 PKU patients, of whom 110 residing in Paran&aacute; and 
  five in other states of Brazil (Santa Catarina and Mato Grosso). Of these, 42 
  were diagnosed at FEPE and began early treatment at the pioneering program of 
  the Association of Parents and Friends of People with Mental Disabilities in 
  S&atilde;o Paulo (APAE-SP). Of the 68 remaining cases, 33 late diagnosed and 
  three early diagnosed cases were excluded from the study because they were older 
  (aged 11, 13, and 14 years) than the rest of the group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The group 
  of 32 PKU children was selected according to the following criteria:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Early diagnosis of PKU (up to 60 days after birth) or persistent hyperphenylalaninemia 
    (HPA);</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Age from 0 to 6 years;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Residence in the state of Paran&aacute;;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Treatment at the FEPE in the capital Curitiba;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Registered at the AFEH-PR, and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Cases diagnosed by FEPE as of December 2001.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  included 27 PKU children diagnosed up to 60 days after birth and 5 children 
  with persistent HPA with early follow-up including clinical and laboratory tests 
  during the pre-treatment period and who began treatment more than 60 days after 
  birth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The central 
  focus of this evaluation was the analysis of the motor status of all selected 
  cases. This analysis was performed using the gross motor function measure (GMFM), 
  which allows for the determination of each patient's motor score, thereby facilitating 
  diagnosis of the presence or absence of any delay or changes in motor development 
  and the respective characteristics and intensity. The GMFM, a standardized observational 
  instrument already validated and described in Canada, initially in 1990,<sup>2</sup> 
  was reviewed in 1993 and 1994<sup>10</sup> and translated into Portuguese by 
  Meyerhof and Gusman (2000).<sup>8</sup> The GMFM consists of 66 items grouped 
  in five different gross motor function dimensions: a) lie down and roll over; 
  b) sit; c) crawl and kneel; d) stand, and e) walk, run, and jump. The target 
  areas corresponding to the expected motor activity for each child's chronological 
  age were based on motor behavior studies from 0 to 6 years by Eckert.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A 10% variation 
  was defined as the cutoff for within normal limits.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The motor 
  score was defined as an outcome measure of the FEPE state reference program 
  in Curitiba. The following data were collected from patient files for analysis: 
  diagnosis (PKU or persistent HPA); post-treatment serum PA; and age at start 
  of treatment. A semi-structured interview was also conducted with the children's 
  parents or guardian prior to the motor assessment. The interview was structured 
  into questions concerning family's socioeconomic status, like income and parents' 
  schooling. The study also attempted to record aspects that might enrich the 
  data analysis on what facilitated or hindered treatment in each case. Quantitative 
  data evaluation was conducted by analysis of simple frequencies using Epi Info 
  6.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical 
  analysis used the R and Statgraphics software programs. The variables are as 
  follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Qualitative 
  and dichotomous variable:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Diagnosis: PKU or persistent HPA (which interferes with the determination 
    of the start of treatment).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Quantitative 
  variables:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Motor score;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Post-treatment serum PA;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Family income;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Age at start of treatment;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Father's years of schooling; and</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Mother's years of schooling.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">These variables 
  were selected in order to investigate the possible factors influencing the results 
  of diet therapy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
  test was used for statistical analysis of data normalcy for each quantitative 
  variable, and at a 5% significance level all variables showed a normal distribution. 
  Thus it was chosen to adopt the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the relationship 
  between the target variable (motor score) and other quantitative variables was 
  evaluated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This present 
  study was conducted under authorization by the Research Ethics Committee at 
  the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/National School of Public Health, in accordance 
  with Resolution 196/96 of the Brazilian National Health Council and related 
  regulations.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of 32 children 
  studied, 16% live in the capital Curitiba and greater metropolitan area and 
  80% in other 21 cities of the state. The relatively small number of cases is 
  distributed throughout the large territory of the state of Paran&aacute;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows the prevalence of cases diagnosed and the coverage of heel prick 
  tests. Only one screening test was considered for each newborn. While calculating 
  the prevalence of diagnosed cases, it was included one case with late diagnosis 
  (born in 1997 and starting treatment only in 1998), but other than the prevalence 
  rate this case was not included in the rest of the data analysis for the group.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Motor scores 
  in the 32 cases studied (PKU and persistent HPA) varied from 86.4 to 121.5. 
  The data show only two cases (6.25%) with motor development below expected, 
  as well as two cases (6.25%) with development above expected for their age. 
  Considering a variation of 10%,<sup>6</sup> the vast majority of the cases (87.49%) 
  presented gross motor function within normal limits. Thus, 93.7% of the children 
  presented satisfactory motor development for their age. One should emphasize 
  that without adequate treatment, all these children would inevitably have developed 
  severe motor and cognitive sequelae.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The motor 
  score in the 5 cases of persistent HPA varied from 90.2 to 101.2, and the mean 
  was lower than that for the total group of PKU children. The mean motor score 
  for PKU children (98.71&plusmn;1.97) differed from the mean motor score of children 
  with persistent HPA (95.92&plusmn;6.31). The difference between the mean scores 
  was 2.79, and was not clinically significant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Motor score 
  results were correlated with the following quantitative variables: mean post-treatment 
  serum PA, father's years of schooling, mother's years of schooling, age at start 
  of treatment, and family income. This correlation is presented in <a href="#tab2">Tables 
  2 through 6</a>, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> shows the motor score distribution grouped in three developmental levels 
  (low, medium, and high) according to mean post-treatment serum PA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Mean post-treatment 
  serum PA showed an optimal concentration (2-7 mg/dl) in 84.37% of the cases 
  and a good concentration (below 10 mg/dl) in 12.5%. Also, it can be noted that 
  two cases with low motor development level present higher serum PA levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Pearson 
  correlation coefficient (r) found in the association between motor score and 
  mean post-treatment serum PA (mg/dl) was r=-0.0051. This shows a weak and inverse 
  relationship between the variables, i.e., mean post-treatment serum PA had little 
  influence on motor score results. This result was not statistically significant 
  at a 5% significance level and a correlation coefficient p-value of 0.9788.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a> shows motor score distribution according to father's schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Pearson's 
  correlation coefficient in the association between motor score and father's 
  educational level (years of schooling) was r=0.3512 and the correlation coefficient 
  p-value was 0.0488. The statistical significance shows a weak and direct correlation 
  between these two variables.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab4">Table 
  4</a> shows motor score distribution according to mother's schooling. The distribution 
  of these cases was similar to that found between motor score and father's schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The correlation 
  coefficient found in the association between motor score and mother's schooling 
  was r=0.3302. This shows a direct correlation between these variables, i.e., 
  the greater the mother's schooling, the higher the motor score. This result 
  was not found to be statistically significant, considering a 5% significance 
  level and a correlation coefficient p-value of 0.065. However, the p-value is 
  close to the established significance level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab5">Table 
  5</a> shows motor score distribution according to age at start of treatment. 
  The cases of persistent HPA are those that began treatment more than 60 days 
  after birth due to their lower serum PA levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To calculate 
  this correlation, the five cases of persistent HPA that began treatment more 
  60 days after birth were grouped and it was carried out the analysis of motor 
  score versus age at start of treatment in the 27 PKU cases that began treatment 
  up to 60 days or less after birth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The correlation 
  coefficient in the association between motor score and age at start of treatment 
  (in days) was r=-0.405, showing a weak and inverse correlation, i.e., the younger 
  the child at start of treatment, the higher the motor score. Therefore, the 
  earlier treatment is started, the better the motor performance in PKU children. 
  This result was statistically significant at a 5% significance level and a correlation 
  coefficient p-value of 0.03.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab6">Table 
  6</a> shows motor score distribution by family income. According to socioeconomic 
  data, the majority of families (90.6%) have a monthly family income of approximately 
  U$ 340 (four times the Brazilian minimum wage) or less.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The correlation 
  coefficient between motor score and family income was r=0.2134, showing a direct 
  correlation between the variables; the greater the family income, the higher 
  the motor score. This correlation was not statistically significant at a 5% 
  significance level and a p-value of 0.2408.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">PKU prevalence 
  in Paran&aacute; in the study period, including five cases of persistent HPA, 
  was approximately 1:34,500 live births, well below that reported in the literature. 
  Elsewhere in Brazil, in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, Schmidt et al<sup>12</sup> 
  estimated a prevalence rate of 1:12,000 to 1:15,000 live births with PKU.<sup>12</sup> 
  In Rio de Janeiro, estimated data in 1998 showed a total of 87,064 newborns 
  tested, with 4 cases of classical PKU, i.e., a prevalence of 1: 21,766 live 
  births.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The population 
  coverage of the heel prick test in newborns in the state of Paran&aacute; has 
  increased steadily in recent years, from 86.99% in 1996 to 99.01% in 2001. National 
  screening coverage is approximately 50% of all Brazilian neonates.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When evaluating 
  the results of the follow-up and treatment program for PKU children in the state 
  of Paran&aacute;, there was found a 93.75% efficiency rate in cases with early 
  treatment. The two children with low motor scores showed a critical condition 
  in terms of the study variables: low monthly family income and father and mother 
  with little or no schooling, besides having started treatment later. This fact 
  hindered the analysis of each of the socioeconomic variables in the cases in 
  which the program did not achieve good results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In data 
  analysis, no significant relationship was found between motor score and mean 
  post-treatment PA. The diet is prescribed according to each child's metabolism, 
  and serum PA concentration does not interfere directly in motor development 
  when within therapeutic levels. Only one case with a below-average motor score 
  presented a mean serum PA concentration of more than 10 mg/dl.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The challenge 
  of achieving a balanced diet and filling out a food recall form requires that 
  the child's caregivers be able of learning certain basic math operations. In 
  the study it was observed a correlation (with a borderline significant p-value) 
  between parents' schooling and child's motor performance. PKU children whose 
  parents have more schooling tend to show better motor scores. In the present 
  series, 39.1% of the parents have less than four years of schooling. Thus, the 
  program's team should continue to focus on orienting and supporting parents 
  who have less schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 71.9% 
  of the cases studied, treatment started within the first month of life. The 
  correlation between motor score and start of treatment clearly shows that an 
  efficient PKU program requires active case search and a focus on immediate treatment 
  adherence. It is crucial to have an integrated, complex and multidisciplinary 
  system in place in order to handle cases in timely fashion.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
  no significant relationship between motor score and family income in the cases 
  studied. This reveals the efficiency of the support provided to low-income families 
  served by the program, a basic condition for prevention and health promotion 
  measures to be developed successfully due to the high cost of diet therapy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  of screening programs conducted by professionals who are not part of the treatment 
  team need to be evaluated. Evaluation of motor development contributed to the 
  identification of the results of nutritional treatment, especially in younger 
  infants, in whom more specific psychomotor tests are more difficult to perform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The lack 
  of other similar evaluation studies in the literature hampers the generalization 
  and comparison of data. It is important to conduct other such studies that evaluate 
  and disseminate the results of public neonatal screening programs. Transparency 
  of results can increase the programs' credibility and foster immediate treatment 
  adherence. This is particularly important in the case of PKU children.</font></p>
