<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To determine the prevalence of the heavy use of drugs among elementary and 
  high school students in a sample of public and private schools, and to identify 
  associated demographic, psychological, cultural and social factors.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This report describes a cross-sectional study using an intention-type 
  sampling technique that compared public schools in central and peripheral areas 
  and private schools. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was applied. 
  The sample consisted of 2,287 elementary and high school students in the city 
  of Campinas in 1998. Heavy use of drugs was defined as the use of drugs on 20 
  or more days during the 30 days preceding the survey (WHO, 1981). For the statistical 
  analysis, polytomic logistic regression analysis (logit model) was utilized 
  to identify factors that influenced this manner of using drugs.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Heavy use of legal and illegal drugs was found as follows: alcohol 
  (11.9%), tobacco (11.7%), marijuana (4.4%), solvents (1.8%), cocaine (1.4%), 
  medications (1.1%) and ecstasy (0.7%). The heavy use of drugs was greatest among 
  students at the city-center public school who had daytime jobs and studied in 
  the evenings. These students were in the A and B socioeconomic classes and had 
  had little religious education during childhood.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Greater availability of cash and specific socialization 
  patterns were identified as factors associated with the heavy use of drugs among 
  students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An individual's 
  first experiences with drugs often take place during adolescence. During this 
  phase, the individual is particularly vulnerable from a psychological and social 
  point of view. Thus, it is particularly important to study this age group in 
  detail, especially in relation to frequent and heavy use of legal and illegal 
  drugs, and to identify the psychological and sociocultural factors that are 
  associated with such use.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At the request 
  of the Ministry of Health, a group of researchers made four extensive surveys 
  on drug use, covering ten Brazilian state capitals, in the years 1987, 1989, 
  1993 and 1997.<sup>4</sup> Comparison of these four surveys showed that the 
  drugs that were most utilized were alcohol, tobacco and solvents. The surveys 
  also revealed that heavy use of marijuana was increasing in these ten state 
  capitals, as was the use of alcohol in eight of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  national and international studies have analyzed the associations of psychological 
  and sociocultural factors with drug use among students. They have, for example, 
  identified that variables like male gender,<sup>3</sup> age,<sup>10,16</sup> 
  work,<sup>17</sup> family breakup<sup>9</sup> and absence of religion<sup>8</sup> 
  are associated with greater use of drugs among students, in a diversity of sociocultural 
  contexts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In view 
  of this, accurate knowledge of the factors associated with drug use among young 
  people in Brazil has great relevance, since it would allow interventions to 
  be undertaken in relation to behavior and risk factors, with the aim of inhibiting 
  the possible progression to heavy use of legal and illegal drugs, which are 
  progressively addictive and deleterious for the individual.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Previous 
  Brazilian studies on drug use among students have generally been conducted in 
  the state capitals. The present study has also compared different types of schools: 
  central and peripheral public schools, and private schools. It is very plausible 
  that the reality of drug use in different areas of a city may vary, thus revealing 
  epidemiological unevenness within the urban environment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It might 
  therefore be presupposed that, in the peripheral regions of the large Brazilian 
  cities, where there is a higher death rate due to violence and drug trafficking, 
  would also have higher drug consumption. The present work had the objective 
  of determining the prevalence of heavy drug use among elementary and high school 
  students in central and peripheral public schools and private schools, and the 
  sociodemographic, cultural and psychopathological factors that are associated 
  with such use</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This was 
  a cross-sectional study using an intention-type sampling technique that focused 
  on studying three distinct types of school in the city of Campinas, State of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo: city-center public schools, peripheral public schools and 
  private schools. The objective of this was to identify differences in the pattern 
  of alcohol and drug use in distinct areas of the city. The general methodological 
  lines followed were those proposed by the Brazilian Center for Information on 
  Psychotropic Drugs (<i>Centro Brasileiro de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre 
  Drogas Psicotr&oacute;picas</i> – CEBRID), with the adaptations needed because 
  of the objectives and size of the study.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An anonymous 
  self-administered questionnaire based on the CEBRID questionnaire was utilized. 
  In accordance with the procedure standardized and recommended by CEBRID, it 
  was applied collectively, in the classroom, without the presence of the teacher. 
  A clear and detailed explanation of the research objectives was given to the 
  students, with an emphatic guarantee of the anonymous and confidential nature 
  of the questionnaire. Doubts regarding the questions were clarified and the 
  questionnaires were gathered in after around 50 minutes. The sample size was 
  calculated using the Epi Info software, from a pilot study. This sample size 
  calculation was done by estimating 5% of the type I (alpha) error with a finite 
  population estimated to be 100,000 students in the city, at the schooling levels 
  being studied, without replacement; drug user prevalence of 1%; and design errors 
  of no more than 1%, with delta precision of 1%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 
  objective was to compare substantial differences in behavior between public 
  schools in central and peripheral locations and private schools, for each schooling 
  level, a minimum sample of 367 elementary and 367 high school students for each 
  of the three intended school types became necessary. Thus six sets of 400 students 
  were formed, totaling 2,400 students. The elementary school students were drawn 
  from the sixth and eighth grades, and the high school students from the first 
  and third years of high school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  school lists supplied by the education authorities, an intentional choice of 
  participants was made. Two city-center public schools, two peripheral public 
  schools and three private schools were selected that all catered for elementary 
  and high school education. From the lists of students and classes of 35 students, 
  six classes were drawn by lots from each school year, per school. All the students 
  present were invited to fill out the questionnaires. During the survey, no irregularity 
  in student attendance was noted in the classrooms visited. All students who 
  answered the questionnaire were included, and 86 students aged over 26 years 
  were then excluded, since they were over the age limit for the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A total 
  of 2,375 questionnaires were applied. No student refused to answer it. Two questionnaires 
  were rejected because they were incompletely filled in or the questions had 
  not been understood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently, 
  the sample consisted of 2,287 students from the elementary and high school levels 
  of central and peripheral public schools and private schools in the city of 
  Campinas, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, in the year 1998. The official estimates 
  for the number of students enrolled in the city at that time indicated that 
  there were around 56,000 students in the sixth to eight grades of elementary 
  school and 52,000 in high school. Thus, the sample studied represented approximately 
  2% of the student total.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Heavy use 
  of drugs was defined in accordance with the World Health Organization (1981) 
  definition,<sup>18</sup> as the use of drugs on 20 or more days during the 30 
  days preceding the survey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To identify 
  the factors that influenced the use of drugs, logistic regression analysis (logit 
  model) was utilized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The drugs 
  studied were alcohol, tobacco, non-prescription psychotropic medications, marijuana, 
  cocaine and ecstasy. The regressive variables were the type of school (peripheral 
  public, central public or private); level of schooling; period of the day when 
  students studied; gender; socioeconomic class; work; preferred type of leisure 
  activities; parents' marital situation; who students lived with; who students 
  had been brought up by over the last two years; whether students felt supported 
  and understood by their parents; whether they felt supported and understood 
  by their friends and/or girlfriend/boyfriend; whether they had a religion; religious 
  affiliation; religious education during childhood; and the GHQ12 (<i>General 
  Health Questionnaire 12</i>), which assesses minor psychiatric symptoms like 
  anxiety, depression and insomnia and was validated in Brazil by Mari &amp; Willians,<sup>7</sup> 
  1985.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 
  use of several drugs (multiuse) is known to be frequent and, with the aim of 
  comparing students who did not use any drug during that month with those who 
  made heavy use, a variable called DRUG was created for the present study, which 
  assumes a value of 0 if the student <i>did not make use of any of the drugs 
  cited in the study during the past month</i>, and 1 if he or she <i>makes use 
  of at least one drug on 20 days or more of the past month (heavy use of at least 
  one of the drugs cited in the study).</i> Heavy use of legal and illegal drugs 
  is generally the type of use that precedes chemical dependence and all its medical, 
  psychological and social-familial consequences.<sup>13</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prevalence</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The heavy 
  use of drugs occurred in the following manner: alcohol (11.9%; N=269), tobacco 
  (11.7%; N=265), marijuana (4.4%; N=101), solvents (1.8%; N=40), cocaine (1.4%; 
  N=32), psychotropic medications (1.1%; N=24) and ecstasy (0.7%; N=17).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Multivariate 
  analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The multivariate 
  logistic regression estimates for heavy use of drugs are presented in <a href="#tab2">Table

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The probability 
  of heavy use of drugs was greater among the students of the city-center public 
  schools who had daytime jobs and studied in the evenings. These students were 
  in socioeconomic classes A and B and had had little religious education during 
  childhood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The probability 
  that students at the city-center public schools would make heavy use of drugs 
  was 4.0 times greater than for those in the peripheral schools. For students 
  who worked, it was 2.5 times greater than for those who did not work. For students 
  who studied in the evenings, it was 2.2 times greater than for those who studied 
  in the mornings. For socioeconomic classes A and B, it was 2.0 times greater 
  than for those in classes D and E. For those who had had little religious education 
  during childhood, it was 1.7 times greater than for those who had had a very 
  religious education. For those who felt they had little support and understanding 
  from their families, it was 1.2 times greater than for those who felt they had 
  a lot of support and understanding from their families. Every additional point 
  on the GHQ-12 scale increased the chance of the student making heavy use of 
  drugs by 1.2 times.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  authors have reported that, for research that has the aim of identifying the 
  prevalence of drug use among students, the method most commonly utilized is 
  the self-administered questionnaire applied collectively in the classroom.<sup>11</sup> 
  This choice is justified by its relative cheapness and high acceptance among 
  the individuals surveyed, since that the refusal rate is less than 1%. This 
  is considered to be a good procedure for obtaining information regarding private 
  behavior, because anonymity is explicitly guaranteed.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
  it must be stressed that the type of questionnaire utilized in the present work 
  measures reports of drug consumption and not the consumption in itself. Caution 
  is therefore needed in the interpretation of the data.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
  limitation of this research design is that, because it is a survey done in the 
  classroom, the young people with more serious involvement with drugs may have 
  already been excluded from the school system, or they may be very frequently 
  absent, and thus may not have been picked out by this study. Studies designed 
  specifically to evaluate the subpopulation that has abandoned or has been expelled 
  from elementary and high schools will be needed to verify this hypothesis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample 
  was not representative of the public and private schools of Campinas, which 
  impedes the extrapolation of the data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The different 
  drugs utilized</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The single 
  drug most utilized heavily in the present study was alcohol (11.9%), closely 
  followed by tobacco (11.7%). Their high prevalence of around 12% indicates that 
  such use is relevant and preoccupying, and must be taken into account in relation 
  to possible educational, preventive and therapeutic actions aimed at young people 
  at school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The illegal 
  drug most utilized in the present study was marijuana (4.4% made heavy use of 
  marijuana). Swadi<sup>16</sup> (1988), in London, and also Stevens et al<sup>15</sup> 
  (1995), in New Hampshire (USA), also detected that the illegal drug most utilized 
  in these contexts was marijuana. In the 1997 survey performed by CEBRID in ten 
  Brazilian state capitals, marijuana use only exceeded solvent use as the drug 
  of greatest lifetime use in the city of Porto Alegre. In the other state capitals, 
  it appeared in second or third position (after solvents and ansiolitics). Comparison 
  of the four CEBRID surveys has shown that frequent and heavy use of marijuana 
  presented statistically significant growth.<sup>4</sup> Marijuana is considered 
  by many young people (and sometimes their families) to be a soft drug, and perhaps 
  for this reason more acceptable<i>.</i> There is evidence, however, that heavy 
  use of the drug has serious implications for the physical and mental health 
  of its users.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Solvents 
  appear just behind marijuana. It is important to remember that these are drugs 
  with great potential for harm to health, due principally to their neurotoxicity.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Differing 
  from the research by Muza<sup>10</sup> (1997), cocaine appeared in the present 
  study ahead of psychotropic medications, occupying the third place among the 
  illegal drugs. Data from the four surveys by CEBRID show that frequent use of 
  cocaine has increased in the state capitals surveyed. Statistical indicators 
  such as hospital internments and seizures of cocaine by the Federal Police also 
  show the growth in the use of this drug.<sup>4</sup> Particularly worrying is 
  the growing use of cocaine in the form of crack, because such use implies the 
  rapid development of dependence,<sup>5,6</sup> involvement in criminal activities<sup>6</sup> 
  and triggering of serious psychiatric conditions.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Ecstasy 
  was the least-used drug, perhaps because it is expensive and still not widely 
  disseminated in the city of the present study, as well as being strictly linked 
  to a specific subculture (dance) and its rituals, such as rave parties<i>.</i><sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sociocultural 
  variables associated with the heavy use of drugs</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At present, 
  most researchers consider that the use of drugs among students is not caused 
  by a single factor, but by a combination of several of them, such as genetic, 
  psychological, familial, socioeconomic and cultural factors. Thus, it is understood 
  that the use of and dependence on drugs are very complex phenomena that cannot 
  be reduced to one facet of a biological, psychological or social nature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, through the multivariate analysis of the data, it was observed that, 
  contrary to what was expected, the use of drugs was lower among students in 
  the peripheral public schools. These are areas of the city where it is thought 
  that there is more drug trafficking, which is supposed because of the higher 
  death rate from violent causes and the seizures of drugs made by the police. 
  Despite the supposed greater drug trafficking in these neighborhoods, the consumption 
  of drugs among the students who attend the schools of the periphery is significantly 
  lower than for those in the central neighborhoods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  sense, it is plausible that financial wherewithal may exercise a significant 
  influence, since in the present study it was found that, in addition to being 
  associated with working, the heavy use of drugs was associated with belonging 
  to socioeconomic classes A and B. Thus, the students at peripheral public schools, 
  despite living in areas of the city where drug trafficking is supposedly more 
  intense, have less purchasing power for buying such drugs. Another possibility 
  is that the young people of these neighborhoods who are involved with the heavy 
  use of drugs end up being expelled from the school system with a certain frequency, 
  and perhaps get involved in small-scale drug trafficking, including for enabling 
  their own consumption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  from the present research also corroborates other studies that show the relationship 
  between greater use of drugs and students who work.<sup>16</sup> The results 
  obtained in relation to work, and those in the literature, give pause for thought 
  regarding some relatively well established beliefs within Brazilian society, 
  such as the idea that free time is a factor that favors the use of drugs. Such 
  a concept would imply the identification of a supposed poor student who would 
  spend most of his free time on the streets and thus would be vulnerable to the 
  use of drugs. For this reason, reflection in relation to working adolescents 
  needs to be refocused from doing work versus not doing work, to how the work 
  is done, or in other words, there needs to be analysis of the quality of the 
  impact of different types of work on young people<i>.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is possible 
  to raise a hypothesis that the association between heavy use of drugs and work 
  found in the present study may have occurred because of at least three factors: 
  the stress consequent to taking on an adult function at an early age that is 
  full of obligations; the financial wherewithal resulting from receiving a salary; 
  and also socialization patterns associated with the "world of work" (for example, 
  drinking at the end of the working day).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A significant 
  religious dimension was also revealed in the present study. Students who had 
  greater religious education during childhood were shown through the multivariate 
  analysis to have significantly less heavy use of drugs. The literature generally 
  shows that young people with some sort of connection to religion make less use 
  of drugs.<sup>8,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Such an 
  association may be related to the moral codes implicit in religions, in which 
  the use of drugs is frequently condemned. In following a religion, a set of 
  values and behavioral patterns is adhered to, among which a prohibition on the 
  use of drugs is included.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The question 
  of family structure is traditionally emphasized when studying the use of drugs 
  among adolescents. In the present study, the importance of the family environment 
  and structure was identified as a possible protective factor against the use 
  of drugs. Less heavy use of drugs was found among students who in some way felt 
  they were supported and understood by their families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  authors have identified risky levels of drug use among young people belonging 
  to families with separated parents or families in which the relationships have 
  degenerated.<sup>8</sup> Thus, the present study corroborates previous research 
  that identified an association between the use of drugs at risky levels and 
  worsened family environments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
  it was seen that increased scores on the GHQ-12 scale were associated with a 
  risk of heavy use of drugs. These data are relevant, since they show a relationship 
  between heavy use of drugs and psychological suffering. These young people have 
  probably found themselves in a situation of serious psychosocial risk, since 
  such clusters of psychological suffering, worsened family environment and heavy 
  use of drugs must facilitate evolution towards chemical dependence, personality 
  disorders and even psychiatric conditions that are more serious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  the present study has identified that the heavy use of drugs is related to sociodemographic, 
  cultural and psychopathological factors that can be grouped as "protectors" 
  and "facilitators". The protective factor identified was a markedly religious 
  education during childhood, which perhaps indicates a more controlled or structured 
  family environment. The facilitating factors for heavy use of legal and illegal 
  drugs that were identified were greater financial wherewithal (socioeconomic 
  class and work), socialization patterns that shape adult-style behavior (work 
  and evening study) and a possibly worsened family environment (feeling less 
  supported and understood by the family). The empirical findings reported have 
  helped in reaching a better comprehension regarding the heavy use of drugs among 
  young people in Brazil's sociocultural environment, and these findings should 
  be taken into account in future research and educational and preventive interventions.</font></p>
