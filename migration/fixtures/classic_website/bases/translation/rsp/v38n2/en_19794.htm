<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  No population-based studies have been conducted to show the potential for the 
  use of virological diagnosis of the rabies virus. The objective of the present 
  study was to estimate accuracy parameters for the isolation of the rabies virus 
  in McCoy cells as an alternative method and to compare this with the use of 
  murine neuroblastoma (N2A) cells, which is considered to be a reference method.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> An evaluation was performed on 120 bats collected at random 
  in the Atlantic Forest of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. The immunofluorescence 
  reaction was utilized for the detection of the rabies virus isolated from the 
  brain of these bats and the presence of the virus was tested in the two cell 
  culture systems. Two data sets were constructed with the results and the analysis 
  was performed using the computer methods for diagnosis tests (CMDT) software 
  by means of the two-graph receiver operating characteristic (TG-ROC) technique 
  to determine sensitivity and specificity parameters, as well as other indicators 
  such as efficacy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood 
  ratio.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> N2A cells presented 90% sensitivity and specificity, while McCoy 
  cells presented 95% sensitivity and specificity. These values were based on 
  cut-off points optimized for each cell type.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The study showed that McCoy cells allowed the obtaining 
  of accuracy estimates that were better than for N2A. The McCoy cell method is 
  therefore an effective method for the isolation of the rabies virus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Murine neuroblastoma 
  cells derived from different clones were introduced for the isolation of the 
  rabies virus from 1978 onwards,<sup>19,23</sup> and also for the study of the 
  pathogenesis of rabies.<sup>22</sup> Cultured cells have also been utilized 
  to produce kits for serology use.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">World Health 
  Organization (WHO) experts used to recommend the inoculation of the rabies virus 
  in young mice (up to 21 days old), known as the biological test, in which the 
  diagnostic examination was done after death. However, after successive studies 
  that compared inoculation in mice with isolation of the virus in murine neuroblastoma 
  cells, they accepted that this latter method could be utilized for diagnosing 
  the disease, in conformity with the methodology described in the laboratory 
  technique manuals for rabies.<sup>3,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
  results from the isolation of the rabies virus in McCoy cells<sup>12</sup> demonstrated 
  that these cells easily isolate the rabies virus. In studies comparing the results 
  obtained from titration in mice and McCoy cells (end point calculations),<sup>13</sup> 
  excellent replication of the rabies virus in McCoy cells has been demonstrated, 
  thereby indicating the possible use of these cells in rabies virus assays.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">McCoy cells 
  present the characteristic of great sensitivity for rabies virus isolation. 
  A clinically suspected rabies case was described,<sup>14</sup> in which the 
  classic biological test did not detect the rabies virus. The virus was isolated 
  from the patient's spinal fluid and it was subsequently proven that this was 
  in fact a case of human rabies, after a long period without the occurrence of 
  autochthonous rabies in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This capacity 
  of McCoy cells for isolating the rabies virus, even at low concentrations (low 
  viral load), makes this method a very useful tool in the study of the circulation 
  of the rabies virus in natural forest reservoirs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It must, 
  however, be remembered that despite its efficacy, the rabies virus isolation 
  method using McCoy cells has not yet been validated for use in disease diagnosis 
  laboratories. Nonetheless, isolation of the rabies virus via these cells greatly 
  facilitates the diagnosis, since the results from this method are compatible 
  with the biological test. Moreover, these cells are easy to handle and have 
  much lower maintenance costs than murine neuroblastoma cells (N2A) because, 
  as well as requiring minimal nutritive medium, McCoy cells also only need half 
  as much bovine fetal serum for supplementing the culturing medium. Nor can the 
  costs be compared with the maintenance costs of a colony of mice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Effectively, 
  what was missing was a population-based study for validating this alternative 
  methodology. The present study was therefore devised with the objective of validating 
  the McCoy cell methodology, utilizing N2A cell culturing as a reference method, 
  in accordance with the validation model proposed by Greiner &amp; Gardner.<sup>8</sup> 
  These authors attributed a utility value to receiver operating characteristic 
  (ROC) curves, since graphical analysis allows estimates of important parameters 
  to be made, thereby obtaining the best relationship between sensitivity and 
  specificity and optimizing the cutoff value for a given target population with 
  a known prevalence.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The validation 
  study was performed on a random sample of bats captured in the Intervales State 
  Park, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, and evaluations of the presence of 
  rabies virus infection were made using the two cell culture systems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Five collections 
  were made over a 20-month period, in which adult bats of various species and 
  both sexes were captured. This was therefore an epidemiological survey (screening) 
  for assessing the presence of naturally circulating rabies virus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  from the study were compared by means of indicative measures such as sensitivity, 
  specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, efficiency, 
  Youden index,<sup>24</sup> incorrect classification and positive and negative 
  likelihood ratio, utilizing the technique of Two Graph Receiver Operating Characteristic 
  (TG-ROC),<sup>7</sup> by means of the Computational Methods for Diagnostic Tests 
  (CMDT) program.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The isolation 
  attempts were performed by means of inoculation of 2% solution of liquefied 
  brain from each captured bat (analysis unit), into the two different cell culture 
  strains: murine neuroblastoma cells (N2A; reference method) and McCoy cells<sup>12</sup> 
  (method to be validated). Two consecutive runs of each brain solution were done 
  in each cell culture type. The second run was done on 96-well plates, with three 
  wells per analysis unit (brain). To preserve the conditions of a blind test, 
  each brain was numbered and coded, thereby making it impossible to recognize 
  the bat species that was being analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The laboratory 
  diagnostic interpretation was based on reading the fluorescent foci observed 
  directly from the wells after the direct immunofluorescence, using an inverted 
  IM-35 microscope IM-35 (Zeiss).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  variable was thus linked to the laboratory diagnosis, which ranged across a 
  scale from zero to 4+. The reaction was considered to be positive for values 
  of 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The bat 
  sample size calculation<sup>11</sup> was based on the rabies prevalence that 
  was predicted and already known from isolation using murine neuroblastoma cells 
  (N2A),<sup>20</sup> which was set at 10%. The precision was stipulated to be 
  5% and the confidence interval 95%. The minimum number of bats required was 
  estimated to be 138. Although 166 bats were captured, only 120 were analyzed, 
  due to losses and the exclusion of pregnant females. Thus, it was necessary 
  to adopt other parameters for finite populations, in accordance with the same 
  authors.<sup>11</sup> It was therefore considered that, for a sample of 120, 
  the prevalence of the disease in a population in which the disease is not endemic 
  would range from 0.3 to 1.5% (representing the expected number with the desired 
  characteristic) and so the same 10% prevalence of infection expected via the 
  N2A method was maintained. The number of 120 bats was considered to be the minimum 
  sample size to be studied with a confidence interval of 95%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A complementary 
  sample of 19 bats from the Zoonosis Control Center of the Municipality of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo was also utilized. The objective was to compare the results obtained from 
  isolation in cell cultures (McCoy and N2A) with the biological test (inoculation 
  in mice), to assess the degree of concordance between the three methodologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  from the diagnoses made on the 120 bats were placed in a databank supported 
  by the Epi Info 6.4 program,<sup>5</sup> and were subsequently exported to other 
  statistical programs such as Medcalc<sup>18</sup> and CMDT.<sup>4</sup> These 
  programs enabled calculation of the sensitivity and specificity parameters and, 
  from these, other indicators: efficiency, Youden index,<sup>24</sup> likelihood 
  ratios, incorrect classification and the positive and negative prediction values.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to obtaining the optimized values, i.e. with the least losses in the sensitivity 
  and specificity parameters, the best value for the cutoff point for the diagnostic 
  method was also determined. The Bland &amp; Altman technique<sup>2</sup> was 
  utilized for assessing the sampling bias, and the Passing-Bablok technique<sup>15</sup> 
  for checking the linearity between the two methods. Wilcoxon<sup>17</sup> statistics 
  were run to evaluate the differences between the averages for the two groups 
  (N2A and McCoy cell systems), and the Spearman correlation coefficient<sup>17</sup> 
  was determined for checking the correlation between the two methods.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS 
  AND DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Via the 
  Wilcoxon test,<sup>17</sup> the difference between the averages gave a p-value 
  of 0.046, with 15 positive differences and 23 negative differences between the 
  paired results, which represented a significant difference, albeit very close 
  to the significance limit of 0.05. The Spearman test,<sup>17</sup> comparing 
  the same paired results from the two methods, detected that there was a statistically 
  significant correlation (p=0.0001) between the two methods, with r=0.614 (0.489-0.715).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a> shows the straight-line Passing-Bablok regression<sup>15</sup> and demonstrates 
  linearity between the two methods, although significant proportional deviation 
  is presented (p&lt;0.01). This analysis was performed by means of testing a 
  hypothesis, and this is presented in the Appendix.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  Bland &amp; Altman analysis,<sup>2</sup> the result observed also showed that 
  there was no bias in the sampling, even though the resultant average value from 
  the differences between the pairs of readings from the two cell systems was 
  -3.5, when the ideal average should be zero. Nonetheless, this value is within 
  the tolerance limits, i.e. within the limits of the average plus two standard 
  deviations, when considering a non-biased sample that is interpreted in the 
  light that one method could substitute for the other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig2a">Figures 
  2A</a> and <a href="#fig2b">2B</a> show the TG-ROC graphs for the two cell systems 
  (N2A and McCoy), with the determination of the optimized values for the sensitivity 
  and specificity parameters. Another important result obtained from the graphs 
  was the cutoff point, because this enabled the minimization of the effects of 
  false positives and false negatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> shows the indicators obtained using the most appropriate cutoff point 
  from the graphical analysis that was performed using the TG-ROC technique to 
  optimize the sensitivity and specificity parameter estimates. In the case of 
  N2A cells, these estimates were 90% for both sensitivity and specificity, and 
  the cutoff point that determined these indicators was 1+, i.e. 25% of the cells 
  in the microscope field were infected. For this cutoff point, the estimates 
  of other indicators also presented optimized values: the test efficiency indicator 
  was 90%, while the probability of classifying the observed results wrongly was 
  9%. The positive likelihood ratio, defined as the chance that a positive result 
  would diagnose true disease and not a false result, was 9, which is the same 
  as saying that the chance of a positive result being diagnosed as a true disease 
  is nine times greater than for this diagnosis to represent a false positive 
  result. The negative likelihood ratio for the same cutoff point was 0.11, which 
  implies that for a negative diagnosis there is a chance of 11:100 that this 
  result is a false negative.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to McCoy cells, the same indicators presented results that were better than 
  those observed for N2A cells. The estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 
  95%, despite a cutoff level that was also within the 1+ band. However, the proportion 
  of cells infected corresponded to 38% of the visual field observed under the 
  microscope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The positive 
  likelihood ratio for McCoy cells was 19, thus demonstrating that the chance 
  that a positive diagnosis in a healthy population would be true was 19 times 
  greater than the chance that this was a false positive result, for this cutoff 
  point of 38%. This chance was twice what was found using the N2A cell methodology. 
  Meanwhile, the estimate of the negative likelihood ratio was 0.052, which represented 
  a chance of 5% that the result would be a false negative. This was half of what 
  was found for N2A cells. In other words, for McCoy cells, only 5:100 of the 
  diagnoses could be false negative results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The efficiency 
  of the test using McCoy cells was 95%, thus demonstrating that McCoy cells presented 
  superiority or greater facility for isolating the rabies virus in relation to 
  N2A cells.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, 
  the method of reading at microscope crosshairs may be subjective and present 
  a few variations, depending on the observer. This differs from mechanical reading 
  of optical density or radioactivity, in which the results obtained are continuous 
  numbers. But even so, the immunofluorescence technique presents sensitivity 
  and specificity of 98%,<sup>4</sup> which means that for a well-trained observer, 
  errors would be rare. However, in attributing limiting values it is indeed possible 
  for differences to occur between observers, especially in attributing values 
  between 1+ and 2+. Thus, some false positive or false negative results could 
  occur in this "gray zone", which is also the location where the cutoff point 
  is established. In this situation, the number of results considered to be false 
  positives or false negative could increase or decrease, depending on each observer. 
  It may happen that the cutoff point is decided arbitrarily, thus affecting the 
  definition of the sensitivity and specificity values. This point is therefore 
  a critical factor in laboratory tests.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In <a href="#fig3a">Figures 
  3A</a> and <a href="#fig3b">3B</a>, the distributions of the results from reading 
  at microscope crosshairs can be seen. It is precisely between the values attributed 
  for 1+ and 2+ that there is the greatest difference between the methods. In 
  <a href="#fig2a">Figures 2A</a> and <a href="#fig2b">2B</a>, the cutoff level 
  divides each figure into a left-hand side representing negative values and a 
  right-hand side representing positive values. It can be seen that the cutoff 
  values are above the 1+ value (25%) for N2A cells and at 37.5 % for McCoy cells, 
  thereby eliminating the possible false negative readings and giving a good safety 
  margin for the correct diagnosis. This can also be seen via the Youden index,<sup>24</sup> 
  which has a value of 90% (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It needs 
  to be remembered that the diagnostic tests are not perfect, but a correct diagnosis 
  is highly probable. A test would only be considered perfect when the sensitivity 
  and specificity were 100%, when the prevalence of the disease was correctly 
  ascertained and when compared with the gold standard, remembering that the latter 
  is the method that is capable of reproducing the disease or diagnosing the true 
  disease, for example biopsy.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the case 
  of rabies, the method considered to be the gold standard, other than a postmortem 
  biopsy, could be the inoculation into mice of material collected from the patient 
  (the biological test). In this case, the isolation accomplished through the 
  test will detect the disease and not the infection, as occurs with the two cell 
  culturing methods. Thus, in <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a> it can be seen that 
  the isolations performed on cell cultures show that only the 3+ results obtained 
  from McCoy cells concord with the positive results from the biological test. 
  This is equivalent to 75% of the infected cells observed in the visual field 
  of the microscope. For the three cases that were positive in the biological 
  test, the N2A cells presented two values of 2+ and only one of 3+. The Spearman 
  correlation test<sup>17</sup> presented a strong correlation between the two 
  methods of cell culturing, with an <i>r</i> coefficient of 0.797 (0.536-0.918) 
  and a p-value of 0.0007, while the coefficients between the biological test 
  and the two cell methods presented moderate correlation values of <i>r</i>=0.647 
  (0.273-0.851) and <i>p</i>=0.006 for N2A and <i>r</i>=0.677 (0.536-0.918) and 
  <i>p</i>=0.004 for McCoy. The correlation value between the two cell culturing 
  methods for the second analysis (i.e. relating to the data set of <a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>) was greater than the correlation value for the first analysis (i.e. relating 
  to the data set of <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), but it must be remembered that 
  in the second analysis, the bats were collected from a location with a rabies 
  outbreak, i.e. a place where rabies cases had already been found in bats, thus 
  differing from the first analysis, in which the sample was collected randomly 
  and presupposed healthy animals.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n2/19794_ent3.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In future 
  work, this question of the cutoff point should be analyzed in more detail, to 
  determine the true status of the disease and infection and to indicate whether 
  the virus is circulating among the bat population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  the isolation method utilizing McCoy cells presented accuracy indicators that 
  were all higher than those for N2A cells. Analysis via the TG-ROC technique 
  was very useful for estimating the indicators for this preliminary validation 
  of the two cell systems as diagnostic methods. The graphical analysis of the 
  TG-ROC performed using the CMDT computer program<sup>4</sup> allowed the sensitivity 
  and specificity parameters to be visualized and from these, all the other indicators 
  could be estimated, thereby eliminating the non-parametric sample distribution 
  bias.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The receiver 
  operating characteristic (ROC)<sup>25</sup> technique is considered to be a 
  valuable method for comparing alternative tests for a given diagnostic method. 
  It gives the best sensitivity and specificity parameters for results that present 
  normal distribution, and this is why TG-ROC analysis was the most appropriate 
  technique for estimating the validity parameters in the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
  question that must be analyzed relates to the reference standard utilized. Neuroblastoma 
  cells are an imperfect reference standard because, according to established 
  criteria,<sup>9</sup> negative results from isolation in cells does not always 
  signify that the animal is not infected, since the specificity is not 100%.<sup>8</sup> 
  Even in the test that is considered to be the gold standard in this case, the 
  biological test, it is only possible to obtain a positive diagnosis in situations 
  in which the viral titer presents sufficient lethality to kill 50% of the animals 
  inoculated. Thus, the viral particle concentration needed is greater than the 
  viral concentrations found in forest reservoirs or natural samples.<sup>10</sup> 
  The virus circulating in reservoirs keeps to low concentrations so that infection 
  can take place and be maintained in the species that shelter it.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Isolations 
  performed using cell cultures consider the number of viral particles in the 
  inoculation that would be capable of infecting the cell while not being subject 
  to interference from the immune response. On the other hand, in mice the immune 
  response may interfere with and mask the infection, thus giving rise to asymptomatic 
  infected animals. In such cases, for the immune response to be overcome and 
  the animal to become sick, a greater viral load is needed. Even so, there is 
  no set viral load at which this will take place, and the viral load required 
  may be larger or smaller, depending on the mouse's own capacity to respond well 
  or not, i.e. animals with a good response require larger loads, while those 
  with a poor response require a lower viral concentration to sicken, since they 
  present low immunity. It must also be remembered that low concentrations of 
  live virus may, when inoculated, function as vaccines and induce an immune response. 
  Such theoretical considerations<sup>21</sup> must therefore be taken into account 
  in the choice and analysis of the gold standard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The validation 
  of diagnostic tests without a gold standard may run the risk of bias and overestimation 
  of the results.<sup>8</sup> Study designs may also lead to biased analysis: 
  epidemiological surveys (screening) of infectious diseases, for example, are 
  very difficult to validate because, if the methodology utilized is inappropriate 
  for the diagnosis, there may be subpopulations with latent infection within 
  the sample population. Such factors may lead to biased results. Other validation 
  techniques must then be observed so as to better estimate the accuracy of a 
  new diagnostic method. These involve computed estimates utilizing the maximum 
  likelihood function from the point of view of Bayesian inference.<sup>6</sup> 
  In a future study, an analysis of this type will be performed in order to define 
  the true status of the disease and its prevalence in the forest reservoir studied.</font></p>
