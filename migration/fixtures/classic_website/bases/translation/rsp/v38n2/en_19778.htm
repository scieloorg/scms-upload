<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Sexual intercourse is currently the route of transmission among women that 
  has most contributed to the feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As an ongoing 
  effort to establish more appropriate standards for health counseling, the study's 
  purpose was to investigate the use of contraceptive methods that would also 
  prevent HIV/AIDS women against disease transmission.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> An exploratory study was developed in an outpatient clinic of 
  a public university hospital, a reference center of HIV/AIDS patients in the 
  mid-south region of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, during a 5-month-period 
  (2000 and 2001). The study was carried out in 73 HIV/AIDS women. Data were collected 
  using a semi-structured questionnaire exploring subjects' sociodemographics, 
  contraception method used and HIV status of their sex partners. A descriptive 
  data analysis was performed and the contents of open answers were grouped into 
  themes. Fischer's exact test was applied for analyzing some variables at a 5% 
  significance level. Content analysis was carried out according to Bardin's proposal.<sup>2</sup><br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Most women at reproductive age were married and had been infected 
  almost exclusively through heterosexual contact. Of them, 35.4% reported having 
  an HIV discordant partner and 13.7% used inadequate contraceptive methods that 
  failed to protect them against HIV transmission.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The study results call for the need of continuous education 
  on safer sex among HIV/AIDS women to empower them to discuss with their partners 
  alternative options of exercising their sexuality and to raise awareness on 
  their contraceptive choices in a way to protect their own health, their partner's 
  and even their unborn offspring's health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From 1980 
  to 2001, of 222,356 HIV cases reported in Brazil, 59,624 were women<sup>9</sup> 
  and the faster growing number of heterosexual contact as a transmission route 
  has mostly contributed to the feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.<sup>9</sup> 
  Perinatal transmission is a dramatic outcome of women being affected by HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Biological, 
  cultural, and socioeconomic factors have contributed to the increasing incidence 
  and prevalence of HIV infection among women. Thus, in several societies, women 
  often do not have an active role on choosing how, when and in what conditions 
  they will have sex.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Knowledge 
  of contraceptive methods and their use by Brazilian women has been widely discussed 
  in recent years, from social aspects, such as inequality of rights, opportunities, 
  and financial resources, to political issues since women's health programs have 
  not been effectively implemented.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, to the authors' best 
  knowledge, up to now the government's Women's Health Care Program has not offered 
  any resourceful action for HIV women. Counseling during condom distribution 
  campaigns focus mostly on condom use as preventive against STD/AIDS transmission 
  rather than a targeted contraceptive method.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&Aacute;vila 
  et al<sup>1</sup> noted that the World Health Organization, concerned over the 
  increase in HIV-infected women at reproductive age worldwide, has advised researchers 
  on the need for studies on contraception and HIV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The call 
  from health authorities, the steady increase in HIV cases among Brazilian women, 
  mostly at reproductive age, allied to the effort of providing information to 
  better advise HIV/AIDS women on health prompted the investigation on the use 
  of contraceptive and HIV transmission prevention methods.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An exploratory 
  study was carried out in an outpatient clinic of a public university hospital, 
  a reference HIV/AIDS center located in the mid-southern area of the state of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo. The service also provides care and counseling on prevention 
  to non-infected partners of HIV-infected patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As a patient 
  attending this service usually comes for follow-up visits on average every 3 
  months, a 5-month- study period was established, from December 2000 to April 
  2001, which allowed enough time for patients to reschedule missed appointments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of a total 
  of 83 patients who attended the outpatient clinic during the study period, 73 
  HIV-infected women participated in the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
  HIV-negative women, partners of HIV-infected male patients followed up in the 
  clinic, and those who missed their appointments during the study period. Selection 
  criteria were: female, confirmed HIV infection, 18 years old or older, outpatient 
  follow-up for at least 4 months, and consent to participate in the study. All 
  patients agreed to take part in the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Individual 
  interviews were used for data collection and were carried out in a separate 
  room by a trained researcher who filled out a questionnaire with open and close 
  questions. The data collection tool was divided into two sections: section one 
  was designed for collecting sociodemographic data on the patients, and section 
  two had two questions, one exploring the contraceptive method currently used 
  ("What do you do to avoid getting pregnant?"), and the other on their partner's 
  HIV status ("What did your partner test in the HIV testing?").</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The contraceptive 
  method used question was also designed to indirectly assess the odds of HIV 
  transmission given that some contraceptive methods work for both prevention 
  and contraception.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Sociodemographic 
  data underwent a quantitative analysis. Fischer's exact test with a 5% significance 
  level was used in the analysis of variables contraceptive methods and marital 
  status. The latter was divided into married and non-married.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Open questions 
  underwent content analysis described by Bardin.<sup>2</sup> Answers were recorded 
  literally in the questionnaire by the research interviewer and the following 
  steps were taken during content analysis: 1) All information was obtained from 
  the answers as a way to get indicators on contraceptive methods used and partner's 
  HIV status; 2) All answers were compiled and classified according to common 
  features or relationship clusters, generating categories related to the reported 
  contraceptive methods adequacy or inadequacy; 3) Answers were classified into 
  two categories: adequate and inadequate contraceptive methods. Answers reporting 
  methods effective to prevent both pregnancy and HIV transmission or reinfection 
  were classified as adequate and those indicating contraceptive actions that 
  were ineffective to prevent either HIV infection or pregnancy were classified 
  as inadequate. The answer categorizations were evaluated by two separate evaluators 
  who reached a consensus. Quantitative data analysis was carried out based on 
  established categories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  protocol was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the Botucatu Medical 
  School. All patients were informed on study purposes and consented to participate 
  in the study.</font></p>

  the study.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of them, 
  71.3% were between 19 and 39 years old in the reproductive age group. Most (60.3%) 
  were married or living with a partner, followed by separated, widows, and single 
  women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Schooling 
  was analyzed as years spent at school, determined by the highest grade subjects 
  achieved and successfully completed. Most women in the study (68.5%) had one 
  to eight years of schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding 
  HIV infection route, the vast majority (93.2%) were infected via heterosexual 
  contact.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">HIV status 
  of the women's regular sexual partner were not drawn from medical reports but 
  instead from information given by the women themselves. Of 62 reported having 
  sexual partners, 34 (54.9%) were HIV-infected, 22 (35.4%) tested negative and 
  six (9.7%) did not undergo HIV testing (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Answers 
  to the question "What do you do to avoid getting pregnant?" were nominated according 
  to the contraceptive methods used and classified as adequate and inadequate 
  methods (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
  are examples of answers including methods classified as adequate:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"... <i>I 
  don't want any more children. I have completely eliminated sex from my life</i>." 
  &#91;sexual abstinence&#93;;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"... <i>he 
  always wraps up his doll ..."</i> &#91;use of male condom&#93;;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... 
  we alternate the condom use</i>." &#91;use of either male or female condoms&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Answers 
  that illustrate inadequate methods were as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... 
  I feel secure by taking the pill as he does not always use a condom."</i> &#91;irregular 
  use of male condom and contraceptive pills&#93;;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"... <i>he 
  takes it out before</i> ..." &#91;interrupted intercourse&#93;;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"... 
  sometimes he uses a condom."</i> &#91;irregular use of male condom&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among women 
  studied, 63 (86.3%) reported using adequate methods to avoid pregnancy that 
  were also protective against HIV transmission or reinfection; most (36; 49.3%) 
  reported using male condoms and six (8.2%) using either male or female condoms. 
  Sexual abstinence, considered to be totally safe for preventing pregnancy, and 
  HIV transmission and reinfection was reported by 21 (28.8%) women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of those 
  using inadequate methods, four (5.5%) reported irregular use of male condoms 
  because of their partners' refusal; two (2.7%) reported sporadic use of male 
  condoms along with contraceptive pills and two (2.7%) reported sporadic use 
  of male condoms and having tubal ligation. One (1.4%) reported interrupted intercourse 
  and another one (1.4%) reported having tubal ligation. The use of contraceptive 
  pills was considered an inadequate method given that concomitant use of antiretrovirals 
  reduces the efficacy of oral contraceptives (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a> presents contraceptive methods used that also prevent HIV transmission 
  as well as women's marital status during the study period. Most (86.3%) reported 
  using adequate methods including 35 married women.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The answers 
  distribution related to adequate and inadequate contraceptive methods between 
  married and not married women (single, widow, and separated) showed a statistically 
  significant difference (p=0.0376). Not married women used more adequate preventive 
  and protective methods than the married ones (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing 
  HIV infection cases is seen worldwide among 15 to 49 year old people.<sup>15</sup> 
  At the same time, statistics show a growing number of cases in women. High HIV 
  prevalence among women implies an increase in mother-to-child transmission and 
  growing morbidity and mortality rates in children.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Similar 
  findings were seen in the present study where 71.3% of women aged 19 to 39 years. 
  As it is also a stage of life where pregnancy is most likely, these women should 
  get thorough counseling concerning adequate methods for contraception and prevention 
  of HIV transmission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The desire 
  for maternity is also there among HIV-infected women;<sup>11</sup> however, 
  assisted-reproductive technology is not yet available to most HIV-infected people 
  in Brazil. Since HIV infection does not prevent women and men from desiring 
  having children, this could be overcome by choosing to have a baby at the most 
  appropriate time in the disease course when risk of HIV transmission is lower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, women infected earlier in life when they 
  are most fertile bring about an increase of pregnant women who could infect 
  their children<sup>9</sup>. A rise in the number of cases seen among pregnant 
  women can be attributed to the recommended routine HIV testing in prenatal visits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most women 
  in the present study were married and reported using adequate contraceptive 
  methods that also protected them against HIV infection. The same was seen among 
  not married women who often reported using adequate methods. However, more married 
  women also reported using inadequate preventive methods to avoid pregnancy and 
  HIV infection. This could be explained by the fact that as these women are in 
  a more stable relationship and have a steady partner; they might have found 
  it more difficult to negotiate with their partner the use of protective methods 
  against reinfection that would work as contraception as well. Or else, as Paiva 
  et al<sup>11</sup> pointed out, these women could have a concealed desire, not 
  revealed by them in the study, of having children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  findings now raise the issue on how women can protect themselves against HIV 
  transmission in their relationships. Living in distinctive "macho" cultures 
  these women are not even able to negotiate condom use when they suspect their 
  partner has extramarital affairs. In fact, four women in the study reported 
  irregular use of male condom because their sex partners' refusal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Beckerman<sup>3</sup> 
  calls attention to the fact that before the advent of new therapeutic options 
  HIV-infected patients had a shorter survival and there were few discordant couples. 
  In the present study, i was found that 35.4% women had non-infected sexual partners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A common 
  dilemma experienced by HIV-positive women who have HIV-negative sex partners 
  is whether to have or not children. They usually report feeling highly anxious 
  because of the risk of infecting both their offspring and partner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Studies 
  on the sexuality of HIV-infected women show that, after being tested positive, 
  they go through a period of less sexual activity.<sup>5,12</sup> In the first 
  year they report experiencing a "relationship crisis" and, thus remain sexually 
  abstinent fearing to infect their partner and ashamed to tell them they are 
  infected.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Pereira<sup>12</sup> 
  noted that while investigating the sexuality of HIV-infected women. After getting 
  to know their positive status, women reported feeling embarrassed and tense 
  to talk about it. These women came across a wide variety of feelings and, not 
  being able to experience their sexuality as before, they feared and avoided 
  having relationships, and some even abandoned sexual contact. As the disease 
  forces them to undergo several changes to experience their sexuality, they rather 
  ignore their sexual drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Sexual abstinence 
  was a way of avoidance reported by 28.8% women in the study. It was most often 
  seen in separated women, followed by single and widows. Married woman reported 
  sexual abstinence less frequently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Sexual abstinence 
  is a totally safe practice that eliminates the risk of HIV transmission. However, 
  as Grimberg<sup>5</sup> and Pereira<sup>12</sup> showed, it works as a diversion 
  but does not express a true desire. A similar phenomenon could be seen in the 
  present study. When prompted with the question "What do you do to avoid getting 
  pregnant?", the women studied not only reported the method(s) used (adequate 
  and inadequate methods) but also gave reasons for their choices. It showed that 
  the option for sexual abstinence expressing women's fears of infecting their 
  partner and offspring could not be understood as lack of sexual drive. For some 
  of them, abstinence was an outcome of trauma they experienced having lost previous 
  pregnancies due to intrauterine infection. Some were so traumatized that, anticipating 
  their partner's irregular use of condom, they ensured contraception by taking 
  contraceptive pills at the same time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian 
  studies from 1995 to 1999 show use rates of male condom among HIV-infected women 
  ranging from 10% to 58.5%.<sup>10,15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  studies indicate that male condoms are not used as a result of the partner's 
  refusal for feeling uncomfortable or believing it would hamper their sexual 
  pleasure and masculinity. Furthermore, they evidence women's failure to negotiate 
  with their partner.<sup>4,8</sup> Santos<sup>13</sup> adds that condom is not 
  easily introduced in a couple's relationship. Today the use of a female condom, 
  reported by 8.2%, enables women to overcome their partner's refusal of protecting 
  themselves. And it is emerging as a choice method that could benefit HIV-infected 
  women preventing both pregnancy and HIV transmission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects 
  in Nobre's<sup>10</sup> study claimed that, although health professionals have 
  emphasized the need for condom use as a preventive measure, they were never 
  showed how to use it correctly. Another study warns that physicians were not 
  used to talk much with of HIV-infected women about condom use, safe sex, contraceptive 
  use or any other issues related to their reproductive health.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Oral contraceptive 
  use among HIV-infected women, a method that prevents pregnancy but sexual partner 
  infection, was uncommonly seen in the study sample. This could be partly because 
  these women are well informed on the inefficacy of this contraceptive method 
  as it interferes with antiretroviral drug activity. There is evidence of reduction 
  of the efficacy of oral contraceptives from 18.0% up to 47.0%,<sup>6</sup> and 
  women could get pregnant even on contraceptive use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Santos et 
  al<sup>13</sup> recommend sound counseling on contraceptive method choice and 
  contraceptive use and reinforce the major role of health care team on the attention 
  of HIV-infected patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, 13.7% reported using inadequate methods to avoid pregnancy that could 
  work also to prevent HIV transmission. Most were married and only one was a 
  widow. However, as for their male partners, six were HIV-negatives. Another 
  study carried out in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo observed out that 41.5% of 
  women reported irregular use of male condom regardless their partner's HIV status.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
  no studies in the literature that convincingly approach the reasons why HIV-infected 
  women would engage in risky behavior for either HIV reinfection or unintended 
  pregnancy. A study investigating non-use of condoms by HIV-infected and non 
  HIV-infected couples show that HIV-negative men reported not taking efficacious 
  preventive measures against HIV infection because they did not believe their 
  partners were infected and because they are "macho" men.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Paiva et 
  al<sup>11</sup> note, however, that wanting to have children a human legitimate 
  desire either motivated by religious issues and to give life a meaning or as 
  a gender issue, to build up a feminine or virile identity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers 
  have found that prevention was not a concern for most women who got infected<sup>4,13,15</sup> 
  An explanation for this behavior could rely on the fact that these women are 
  mostly poor, ill-informed and have no negotiation power, which in a way comes 
  close to the widespread idea of AIDS "<i>feminization, internalization,</i> 
  <i>and depauperation"</i> among women.</font></p>
