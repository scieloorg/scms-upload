<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:<i> 
  </i></b>To evaluate the prevalence and determinants of sedentarism among adolescents 
  living in Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A cross-sectional study was carried out in Pelotas, in 2002. 
  An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was answered by a representative 
  sample of 960 adolescents with ages ranging from 15 to 18 years old. Those who 
  reported that their participation in some kind of physical activity amounted 
  to less than 20 minutes a day with a frequency of less than 3 times a week were 
  considered to have a sedentary lifestyle. Sociodemographic and behavioral variables 
  were evaluated. The chi-squared test was used for comparisons between proportions. 
  The Poisson regression was used for multivariate analysis with robust adjustment 
  for variances. Corrections were made for study design effects.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Interviews were held with 960 adolescents. Of these, 39% were 
  classified as having a sedentary lifestyle. The prevalence of sedentarism was 
  higher among girls than among boys (prevalence ratio of 2.45; 95% CI 2.06-2.95). 
  The adolescents from lower social levels had the highest percentage of sedentarism 
  (prevalence ratio of 1.35; 95% CI 1.06-1.72). There was an inverse relationship 
  between the adolescent's and the mother's schooling and sedentarism. After adjusting 
  for confounding factors, there was also a positive association between sedentarism 
  and minor psychiatric disturbances, and in relation to sexual activity.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Higher prevalences of sedentarism are associated with girls, 
  low social class, low levels of schooling and being the child of a mother with 
  a low level of schooling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The regular 
  practicing of physical activity has an inverse relationship with the risk of 
  developing chronic-degenerative diseases and has a positive effect on quality 
  of life and other psychological variables.<sup>5,17,20</sup> Developed countries 
  have, through their institutions and organizations, concentrated their efforts 
  in the field of public health and disease prevention (such as in relation to 
  coronary diseases and hypertension) on the reduction of sedentarism, by means 
  of plans for adopting regular physical activity, in order to improve individual 
  and collective health.<sup>5,17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the United 
  States, more than 60% of adults and around 50% of adolescents are considered 
  to be sedentary, according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention 
  and Health Promotion.<sup>5</sup> In Brazil, data from the Brazilian Institute 
  for Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica 
  – IBGE) have shown that 80.8% of adults are sedentary.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  Mello et al,<sup>14</sup> in a survey in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, found 
  a sedentarism prevalence of 68.7% among adults.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Adolescents 
  have been targeted in studies around the world, since they present high indices 
  of risky behavior, such as a decreased habit of regular physical activity,<sup>3,5,16,20</sup> 
  irregular eating habits<sup>1,5,9,16,18</sup> and psychological disturbances.<sup>19</sup> 
  In addition to this, other studies have affirmed that the physical activity 
  habits during adolescence are partially determinant for the levels of physical 
  activity during adulthood.<sup>5,7,22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
  few studies with samples of Brazilian adolescents. Most of these were performed 
  in schools, and the results presented sedentarism percentages ranging from 42 
  to 94%.<sup>8,9,10,18,22,23</sup> These findings indicate discrepancies that 
  can be explained by the differences in sampling and methodological processes 
  applied in the research. According to Pinho &amp; Petroski<sup>18</sup> (1990), 
  the difficulty in developing instruments that could determine the habitual levels 
  of practicing physical activity have limited and made it impossible to obtain 
  conclusive information regarding the physical behavior of children and adolescents, 
  considering that more than 30 distinct techniques for measuring physical activity 
  are known.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the light 
  of the growing concern around the world regarding sedentarism among adolescents, 
  and the few population-based studies made in Brazil, the present study had the 
  objective of determining the prevalence of sedentarism and associated factors 
  among adolescents living in an urban area in southern Brazil.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  investigation formed part of a wide-ranging survey for assessing the health 
  of adolescents in Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, in a cross-sectional 
  population-based study by means of systematic sampling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Considering 
  a sedentarism prevalence of 30%, a margin of error of five percentage points, 
  a confidence level of 95% and statistical power of 80, and with a 10% allowance 
  for the possible loss rate, it was estimated that it would be necessary to interview 
  504 individuals aged 15 to 18 years. The actual sample size of 1039 individuals 
  was justifiable in the light of the multiple objectives of the survey, of which 
  the present study formed part.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sampling 
  was done in multiple stages, from the 448 census sectors of the urban zone of 
  Pelotas. Of these sectors, 90 were drawn systematically for inclusion in the 
  survey. Following this, one street block was randomly selected from each sector. 
  Next, one street corner was drawn from this block, to form the starting point 
  for the survey. From this corner, 86 homes were visited systematically. When 
  necessary, houses from other blocks were included, which were chosen in a standardized 
  manner so as to complete the number of 86 homes. In total, 7,740 homes were 
  visited by the survey team.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">All the 
  adolescents aged between 15 and 18 completed years who were living in the drawn 
  homes were interviewed, after obtaining written consent from the parents or 
  other adult responsible for the adolescent. After weight and height measurements 
  were taken, the adolescents were given a self-administered questionnaire to 
  answer, which had previously been tested, standardized and precoded, containing 
  questions relating to sex, age, the parents' and adolescent's schooling, sexuality, 
  minor psychiatric disturbances, overweight and physical activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To determine 
  the prevalence of sedentarism, the questions utilized encompassed the practicing 
  of physical activity at school and outside of school, the time in minutes spent 
  in the daily activity and the frequency in number of times per week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Adolescents 
  were considered to be sedentary when they said they were not participating in 
  any type of physical activity at school or outside of school, or participating 
  in physical activity for periods of less than 20 minutes a day and with frequencies 
  of less than three times a week.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To define 
  the social class, the classification of the Brazilian Association of Market 
  Research Institutes (Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Institutos de Pesquisa 
  de Mercado –Abipeme) was utilized,<sup>4</sup> which places individuals into 
  socioeconomic categories according to information on the schooling of the head 
  of the household and the possession of certain "comfort items" such as television 
  set, refrigerator, radio, car and household employees. This classification puts 
  people into the classes A, B, C, D or E, according to the scores attained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The occurrence 
  of minor psychiatric disturbances was assessed by the Self-Report Questionnaire 
  (SRQ-20).<sup>13</sup> The cutoff point utilized for men was six or more and 
  for women, five or more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  on whether the adolescent had already had sexual relationships were obtained 
  via dichotomous questions of "yes" or "no" type.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  relating to weight were obtained by means of a portable balance with a precision 
  of 0.5 kg. Individuals were weighed without shoes and while wearing light clothes 
  and not carrying heavy objects. The clothes worn were noted and a correction 
  for clothing weight was subsequently made. To measure the height, a portable 
  anthropometer developed by the team was utilized, which had a margin of error 
  of 1 cm. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula: BMI = (body 
  mass in kg)<sup>2</sup> / (height in m)<sup>2</sup>. Adolescents were considered 
  to be overweight when they presented a BMI of greater than or equal to 25 kg<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, 
  as in Fonseca et al<sup>6</sup> (1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  collected were processed using the EpiInfo 5.0 program, with automatic checking 
  of the amplitude and consistency. Univariate analysis, performed via the SPSS 
  for Windows 8.0 statistical package, verified the frequency of the responses 
  among the variables. For comparisons between proportions, the chi-squared test 
  was utilized. For multivariate analysis, Poisson's regression with robust adjustment 
  for variances was utilized, with checking for delineation effects. The data 
  were analyzed hierarchically: the sociodemographic variables (sex, age, parents' 
  schooling and social class) were entered at the first level; the adolescent's 
  schooling at the second level; and the behavioral variables (minor psychiatric 
  disturbances, overweight and sexual activity) at the third level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  hierarchical model, each block of variables for a given level was included, 
  and variables with a value of p<u>&lt;</u>0.20 in the likelihood ratio test 
  were kept in the model. In this type of model, variables located within a level 
  that is hierarchically superior to that of a hierarchically inferior variable 
  are considered to be potential confounders of the relationship between this 
  variable and the outcome being studied. On the other hand, variables located 
  within lower levels are considered to be potential mediators of the association. 
  The variables selected within a given level were kept for the subsequent models 
  and were considered to be risk factors for sedentarism, even if they lost their 
  significance through the inclusion of hierarchically inferior variables.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
  1039 adolescents living in the homes that were visited. Interviews were held 
  with 960, which formed a representative sample of the adolescents living in 
  the urban area of the municipality of Pelotas. For the remaining 79 adolescents, 
  the interview could not be held because the parents or guardians refused authorization, 
  or the adolescent refused to answer the questionnaire, or the adolescent was 
  not found at home after three visits. The loss rate was therefore 7.6%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the sample 
  studied, 39% of the adolescents were considered to be sedentary. The <a href="#tab">Table</a> 
  shows that the prevalence of sedentarism was related to the adolescent's sex, 
  indicating that girls are more sedentary than boys (54.5% and 22.2%, respectively). 
  A greater tendency towards sedentarism was observed among adolescents aged 17 
  to 18 years (38.9% and 44.8%). The prevalence of sedentarism was also greater 
  among adolescents who had attended school for up to four years (58.02%), in 
  relation to those who had attended for five to eight years (36.5%) and those 
  who had attended for nine or more years.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of sedentarism among adolescents presented an association with social class, 
  as shown in the <a href="#tab">Table</a>. The frequencies of sedentarism differed 
  between the classes D+E and A+B (prevalence ratio of 1.71; 95% CI 1.38-2.13). 
  The mother's schooling also presented an association with a sedentary lifestyle 
  for the adolescent. The children of mothers with least schooling (up to four 
  years) presented a greater risk of sedentarism (prevalence ratio of 2.00; 95% 
  CI 1.58-2.54), than those whose mothers had had five to eight years of schooling. 
  On the other hand, sedentarism among the adolescents was independent of the 
  father's schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="#tab">Table</a> 
  shows that adolescents with indications of minor psychiatric disturbances also 
  presented a more sedentary lifestyle (prevalence ratio of 1.16; 95% CI 1.00-1.35), 
  in relation to those without such disturbances. There was an association between 
  sedentarism and sexual activity among the adolescents, as shown in the <a href="#tab">Table</a>. 
  The adolescents who reported that they had already had sexual relationships 
  presented lower risk in the non-adjusted first analysis (prevalence ratio of 
  0.93; 95% CI 0.78-1.10). Sexual activity thus formed a protective factor for 
  sedentarism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="#fig">Figure</a> 
  shows that, at the first level of multivariate analysis, it was found that the 
  lower social classes (D and E) presented a risk of sedentarism that was 1.35 
  times greater than for classes A and B. Females presented a greater risk of 
  sedentarism than males did (prevalence ratio of 2.35; 95% CI 2.00-2.86). The 
  mother's schooling also presented an association: children of mothers with a 
  low level of schooling presented a risk of sedentarism that was 1.75 times (95% 
  CI 1.01-2.23) greater than for children of mothers with a higher level of schooling. 
  With regard to age, the adolescents tended to present a more sedentary lifestyle 
  as they grew older. The adolescents aged 15 years presented less prevalence 
  of sedentarism (prevalence ratio of 0.82; 95% CI 0.67-0.99), in relation to 
  those aged 18. In other words, being 15 years old was a protective factor in 
  comparison with being 18 years old. At the second level, the adolescent's schooling 
  presented an association with sedentarism, even after adjustment for social 
  class, age, sex and mother's schooling, since adolescents with a low level of 
  schooling presented a risk of sedentarism that was 1.30 times (95% CI 1.01-1.68) 
  greater than for those with more schooling. At the third level, the behavior 
  was analyzed. Those that presented indications of minor psychiatric disturbances 
  also presented a greater risk of sedentarism (prevalence ratio of 1.16; 95% 
  CI 1.00-1.35). To have already had sexual relationships presented an association 
  with lower risk of sedentarism for the adolescent, after adjustment (prevalence 
  ratio of 0.84; 95% CI 0.71- 0.99), and thus was maintained as a protective factor. 
  In other words, having sexual relationships diminished the risk of sedentarism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study was formed by a representative sample of the adolescents living in the 
  urban zone of the municipality of Pelotas, in southern Brazil. The response 
  rate was 92.4%, which thus diminishes the possibility that selection bias may 
  have occurred.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of sedentarism among the adolescents in Pelotas was 39%: 22.2% for the boys 
  and 54.5% for the girls. This was therefore lower than what was observed by 
  Gomes et al<sup>8</sup> in Rio de Janeiro: 59.8% for boys and 77.8% for girls. 
  In the United States, a survey by the National Centers for Disease Control and 
  Prevention<sup>5</sup> showed a 50% prevalence of sedentarism among adolescents. 
  These differences may be explainable, for example, by the great difficulty in 
  standardizing the methodological processes for measuring sedentarism. The instruments 
  utilized in Brazilian studies over the past decade have differed from each other 
  in many aspects: some have used electronic and mechanical measurement methods,<sup>14,18</sup> 
  while others have made use of self-administered questionnaires that form a record.<sup>10,19,20,23</sup> 
  However, no instrument has been identical to any other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The different 
  magnitudes ascribed to physical activity in relation to sedentarism have been 
  another limitation on the studies encountered. Differences in sampling type 
  also represent limitations on comparative analyses. Some studies have been done 
  only among male adolescents,<sup>18</sup> and other among adolescents of different 
  ages.<sup>10,14,18</sup> Some authors, moreover, have measured adolescents, 
  adults and elderly people at the same time,<sup>8</sup> while a good part of 
  the studies relate to school populations.<sup>14,22</sup> There was therefore 
  a need to investigate groups that are more representative of the adolescent 
  population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study has sought to establish parameters relating to the real adolescent population 
  in the region, using a measurement technique for sedentarism that is more appropriate 
  for population-based studies. Self-administered questionnaires that form a record 
  have good applicability to large groups and present low cost.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to the risk factors for sedentarism, the socioeconomic variables presented associations. 
  Adolescents in the social classes D and E presented a risk of sedentarism that 
  was 1.35 times greater than for those in classes A and B. Some studies have 
  presented similar data,<sup>2</sup> thus showing that a state of poverty is 
  a complication in the fight against sedentarism, with possible repercussions 
  in the occurrence of chronic diseases in adulthood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The adolescents 
  with a low level of schooling also presented a greater risk of sedentarism, 
  as did those whose mothers presented a low level of schooling. Moore et al<sup>16</sup> 
  (1991) showed that the children of active mothers are twice as active as the 
  children of inactive mothers. This result may be attributable to the relationship 
  between schooling and social class, thus forming a direct relationship with 
  the risk of sedentarism, as affirmed by Browson et al<sup>2</sup> (2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The boys 
  tended to be more active than the girls.<sup>5,17</sup> The results showed that 
  girls are more sedentary than boys, with a prevalence ratio that is 2.35 times 
  greater. Programs directed towards girls need to be implemented so that they 
  can thus enjoy the beneficial effects on health from reduced sedentarism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Even though 
  the prevalence of sedentarism in the present study (39%) was within the patterns 
  found in the literature, it is a matter for concern in adolescence. As indicated 
  by some studies, in addition to being a risk factor for large numbers of illnesses 
  at this stage of life, the risk increases with age, which may indicate that 
  a sedentary lifestyle will be adopted in adulthood. <sup>5,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Reynolds 
  et al<sup>20</sup> (1990) verified that psychosocial variables were significantly 
  associated with sedentarism. The results from the present study concord with 
  the data encountered in the literature, in which adolescents with indications 
  of minor psychiatric disturbances present a greater risk of sedentarism (prevalence 
  ratio of 1.16; 95% CI 1.00-1.35). Because of the limitation of cross-sectional 
  studies, it is not possible to say whether they are more sedentary because they 
  present minor psychiatric disturbances, or whether they present minor psychiatric 
  disturbances because they are sedentary, while also emphasizing the possible 
  reversibility of these findings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There is 
  evidence that overweight and obesity are strongly associated with a sedentary 
  lifestyle.<sup>1,5,17</sup> The present study did not show up such an association, 
  just as in some others in the literature.<sup>9</sup> This is a limitation of 
  cross-sectional studies, which raises the possibility that the methodology utilized 
  for determining the categories of overweight, as measured by the body mass index 
  (BMI), may have presented measurement bias.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
  of its low cost, the methodology utilized in the present study could be reapplied 
  in other locations and thus contribute towards providing data on trends and 
  differentials in sedentarism in different regions of the country.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study has indicated the participation of biological, behavioral and cultural 
  factors in determining sedentarism. Attempts have been made to improve the health 
  conditions and quality of life of adolescents through reducing their sedentarism.<sup>5,17</sup> 
  It is known, however, that such measures, although important, have not been 
  efficacious. There is interference from the communication media in adolescents' 
  daily lives, especially from visual media, and such influence works against 
  adherence to physically active behavior. The main risk factors for sedentarism 
  revealed in this study were low levels of schooling among the adolescents and 
  lower social class, and also the greater risk of sedentarism presented by girls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Population-based 
  studies are of great importance for furnishing data on the prevalence of sedentarism. 
  Such data allows programs for health promotion and the encouragement of regular 
  physical activity practices to be planned and implemented.</font></p>
