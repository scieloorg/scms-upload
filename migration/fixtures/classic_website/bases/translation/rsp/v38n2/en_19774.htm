<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To describe the adaptation to Portuguese of the short version of the "job 
  stress scale", originally in English.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> We evaluate six aspects of equivalence between the original 
  scale and the Portuguese version: conceptual, semantic, operational, item, measurement, 
  and functional equivalences. A reliability test-retest study was conducted with 
  94 selected subjects.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Reproducibility (interclass correlation coefficients) for the 
  'demand', 'control', and 'social support' dimensions of the scale was estimated 
  at 0.88, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) 
  estimates for these same dimensions were 0.79, 0.67, and 0.85, respectively.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Our results suggest that the adaptation of the scale was 
  successful, and indicate that its use in the sociocultural context of the studied 
  population (Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de survey) is appropriate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The use 
  of measurement scales in epidemiological studies allows us to evaluate constructs 
  such as stress. The first studies to associate stress in the workplace with 
  health-related outcomes (with emphasis on heart diseases) go back to the early 
  1960's.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Robert Karasek 
  was one of the pioneers in the research of workplace social relations, stress-generating 
  sources, and their repercussions on health. In the 1970's, Karasek proposed 
  a bi-dimensional conceptual model which related two aspects – demand and control 
  in the workplace – to risk of disease. 'Demand' refers to pressure of psychological 
  nature, be it quantitative – e.g. time and speed in performing tasks – or qualitative 
  – e.g. conflict between contradictory demands. 'Control' refers to job decision 
  latitude, the possibility a worker has of employing his or her intellectual 
  abilities in performing job-related tasks, as well as the degree of authority 
  the worker has for making decisions about how to perform such tasks. <sup>13,14</sup> 
  The Karasek model focuses on the work organization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to this model, mean scores are allocated into four quadrants, so as to express 
  the relationships between demand and control (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). 
  The coexistence of great psychological demands and low control over the work 
  process would result in high job strain, with deleterious consequences to health. 
  The scenario combining low demand and low control is also harmful (passive work), 
  since it can generate loss of abilities and lack of interest. On the other hand, 
  when great demands and high control coexist, workers experience the work process 
  in an active fashion: though the demands are excessive, they are less harmful 
  since the worker can plan work hours according to his or her biological rhythm 
  and create strategies to deal with eventual difficulties.13 The 'ideal' scenario, 
  low job strain, combines low demand and high control of the work process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A third 
  dimension, social support in the workplace, was added to the model by Johnson, 
  in 1988.<sup>14</sup> This dimension is concerned with the level of social interaction 
  between worker and colleagues/superiors.<sup>5</sup> Lack of support may also 
  generate negative consequences to health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A short 
  version of Karasek's 49-question questionnaire was designed in Sweden by T&ouml;res 
  Theorell in 1988, comprising 17 questions. Of these, five questions evaluate 
  demand, six, control, and six, social support. The adaptation of this short 
  version<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> is the main subject 
  of the present paper. The original form of the scale is presented in the first 
  part of <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a> below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The section 
  on demand includes four questions related to quantitative aspects such as time 
  and speed for performing tasks, and one question evaluating a predominantly 
  qualitative aspect of the work process, related to the conflict between different 
  demands.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The section 
  on control includes four questions related to the use and development of abilities, 
  and two related to decision latitude in relation to the work process. For both 
  dimensions, the answer options are presented in a Likert-type scale (1-4), ranging 
  between "frequently" and "never/almost never".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The section 
  on social support comprises six questions about the worker's relationship with 
  colleagues and superiors, and includes four answer options arranged in a Likert-type 
  scale, ranging between "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A review 
  of the use and/or adaptation of the job stress scale was carried out in the 
  MEDLINE and LILACS databases. No studies on the adaptation to Portuguese of 
  the short version of the scale, nor epidemiological studies in which this scale 
  had been used were located in MEDLINE. LILACS included a single Brazilian epidemiological 
  study on psychic disorders among female nurses<sup>1</sup> in which the author 
  included a few questions derived from the full version of the demand-control-support 
  scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The aim 
  of the present article is to describe the process of adapting the Swedish short 
  version of the Karasek scale to Portuguese. Adopting this instrument will contribute 
  to the investigation, in the Brazilian context, of various health-related outcomes 
  that may, in their causal mechanism, include a share ascribable to stress in 
  the workplace.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Adapting 
  the scale</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Herdman,<sup>3</sup> one must consider at least six dimensions of equivalence 
  for adequately adapting an instrument to another language. <i>Conceptual</i> 
  equivalence concerns the existence of the same concept in a similar context 
  in both population groups (the one for which the scale was developed and the 
  one in which it will be applied). Such equivalence can be investigated through 
  literature reviews, by consulting specialists or segments of the general population, 
  and through qualitative techniques such as focal groups. Once this dimension 
  is deemed adequate, the remaining dimensions can be investigated. In general, 
  concepts are investigated by means of questions or items, which must be equivalent 
  in both languages (<i>item equivalence</i>). Item equivalence must be judged 
  by specialists or by members of the target population. <i>Semantic equivalence</i> 
  is concerned with the transfer of word meaning between languages and with obtaining 
  a similar emotional effect on the respondent regardless of the language being 
  used. <i>Operational equivalence</i> refers to the general makeup of the questionnaire, 
  including instructions, mode of administration, and measurement methods. <i>Measurement 
  equivalence</i> is evaluated based on the new version's psychometric properties. 
  Finally, once equivalence between both scales is achieved for all previous dimensions, 
  <i>functional equivalence</i> is said to exist between the two versions, that 
  is, both measure the same concepts in different cultures.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The process 
  of adapting the job stress scale consisted of: reviewing both national and international 
  literature databases for articles on prior adaptation/use; research in English 
  and/or Portuguese dictionaries; translation and back translation (with evaluation 
  of processes and results); probing for the solution of eventual doubts; and 
  pre-tests and a test-retest reliability study. The stages of the process are 
  presented <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> and discussed in detail below.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig2"></a></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>English-Portuguese 
  translation</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Dictionary 
  research showed that the Portuguese word <i>'estresse'</i> is an Anglicism based 
  on the English word 'stress'. Its meaning is defined as "the set of bodily reactions 
  to physical, psychic, infectious, or other types of aggression, capable of disturbing 
  homeostasis".<sup>15</sup> The stress-causing agent is termed '<i>estressor</i>'. 
  In English, stress is defined as the pressure or anguish resulting from physical 
  or mental suffering or difficult situations. The adjective 'stressful' refers 
  to the agent tending to induce stress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>'Trabalho'</i> 
  ('work', 'job') is a term of universal usage. In Portuguese, it designates "coordinated 
  activity, of physical and/or intellectual nature, necessary for carrying out 
  any task, service, or enterprise" and "the exercise of such an activity as an 
  occupation, trade, profession, etc&#133;".<sup>9</sup> According to Sociology, 
  <i>'trabalho'</i> designates any human activity applied to the generation of 
  wealth. In English, <i>'trabalho'</i> corresponds to two terms: 'work' or 'job', 
  which mean, respectively, "the appliance of physical or intellectual activity 
  for carrying out a task" and an individual's "occupation".<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The translation 
  of the scale itself was carried out independently by three English-speaking 
  Brazilian translators. Each translator received a document containing instructions 
  on how to carry out the task. According to these instructions, emphasis should 
  be given to the meaning of the terms (<i>semantic equivalence</i>) rather than 
  to literal translation, both in headers and in questions and answer options. 
  Furthermore, translators were instructed to attribute grades (from 0 – no difficulty 
  to 10- maximal difficulty) and to comment upon the degree of difficulty of translating 
  each question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
  consensual version was defined in a meeting between the four study coordinators 
  (specialists in Epidemiology) and the three translators.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Evaluation 
  of the translations</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The consensual 
  version was compared to the English original by two external evaluators (Brazilian 
  epidemiologists, experienced in the use of scales and fluent in English), who 
  gave grades between 0 and 10. Items evaluated included <i>clarity of writing</i> 
  (choice of words and their organization into sentences), <i>use of colloquial 
  language</i> (compatible with elementary schooling), and <i>equivalence in the 
  meaning of questions and answers</i>. The evaluators suggested a few improvements 
  in the translation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Probing</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The words 
  or phrases for which no satisfactory translations were found were submitted 
  to complementary probing,<sup>2</sup> which consists of submitting the translations 
  to six respondents with varying degrees of schooling for comments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Back 
  translation</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A new version 
  including modifications suggested in the previous stages, was presented to two 
  professional translators, who translated the Portuguese version back into English. 
  These were native English speakers and were fluent Portuguese.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Evaluation 
  of the back translation by a specialist panel</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A workshop 
  with a panel of five epidemiologists – experienced in the use of scales and 
  fluent in both languages – compared the original English version, the last Portuguese 
  translation, and the two back-translated versions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pre-testing</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The version 
  obtained at the end of the translation/evaluation process was approved for use 
  in three rounds of pre-testing. The aim of each of the stages was to improve 
  the entire questionnaire of Phase 2 of the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> Study, 
  composed of seven thematic blocks with a total 82 questions, in addition to 
  the adapted scale. The first pre-test (42 volunteers) was answered in groups, 
  whose members filled the questionnaire in the presence of one of the team's 
  researchers and evaluated it as to clarity of question formulation and difficulties 
  found in answering specific questions, among other aspects. The alterations 
  suggested were incorporated, and two other groups, with 33 and 31 voluntaries, 
  respectively, answered the new pre-test following the same dynamics as in the 
  first round. The time taken to answer the questionnaires was registered. All 
  volunteers had similar characteristics to those of the study population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Test-retest 
  reliability study</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Before fieldwork 
  began, a pilot study (1<sup>st</sup> stage of the test-retest study) evaluated 
  101 staff members (see <i>study population</i>, below). Of these, 94 answered 
  the same questionnaire (retesting) after seven days. This group was composed 
  of professionals hired by the same university as the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  target population, but without permanent contracts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Instrument 
  stability and internal consistency</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Two components 
  of instrument reliability were investigated: its stability, through the intraclass 
  correlation coefficient (ICCC), and its internal consistency, through the Cronbach's 
  Alpha coefficient<sup>11</sup> (<i>measure equivalence</i>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">ICCC was 
  estimated based on the answers of the 94 staff members who participated in the 
  test-retest reliability study. For the evaluation of the level of stability 
  of the answers we adopted the cutoff points suggested by Landis &amp; Koch:<sup>6</sup> 
  below 0= poor; 0 to 0,20= weak; 0,21 to 0,40= probable; 0,41 to 0,60= moderate; 
  0,61 to 0,80= substantial, and 0,81 to 1,00= almost perfect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Cronbach's 
  Alpha coefficient evaluates the internal consistency or homogeneity of the questions 
  (items) aimed at measuring a same construct. Coefficients were estimated for 
  each dimension (demand, control, and support) among the 3,547 staff members 
  participating in Phase 2 of the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> Study. A minimum 
  value of 0.70 was recommended by Rowland<sup>10</sup> for considering that different 
  items consistently evaluate a same construct.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Study 
  population</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">After the 
  adaptation process – described in the present paper – was completed, we inserted 
  the short version of the job stress scale into a multidimensional self-administered 
  questionnaire, used in Phase 2 (Sept. 2001 – March 2002) of the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  Study. This is a prospective study with a cohort of 3,574 technical-administrative 
  staff of a Rio de Janeiro university. Phase 1 of data collection was carried 
  out between August and October 1999.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In light 
  of the universality of the concepts 'work' and 'stress', one can assume the 
  existence of <i>conceptual equivalence</i> between both languages, a conclusion 
  corroborated by the panel of specialists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The format 
  of the questionnaire was maintained (<i>item</i> and <i>operational</i> equivalences) 
  with little alteration in individual items. A single new heading was introduced 
  ("Now we have some questions about the characteristics of your work...") preceding 
  the questions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Semantic 
  equivalence was sought throughout all stages of the translation process. In 
  light of the grades given by the translators to the degree of difficulty of 
  each item, most items were easy to translate. The evaluators consistently considered 
  the translation of most questions and answer alternatives as "almost perfect/perfect" 
  (data not shown).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The richness 
  of the evaluation process and the later consensus obtained between translators 
  and study coordination evidenced the greater possibilities generated by opting 
  for the meaning-based rather than literal translation. For example, in the questions 
  related to demand (D), the translation of the word 'intensively' in the question 
  "Do you have to work very intensively?" (D2) generated doubts as to the meaning 
  of intensity in work. In the discussion with the translators, it was not possible 
  to achieve a consensus over this concept. It was thus necessary to resort to 
  the literature in the field of Social Sciences in order to solve this doubt. 
  Marx, in his book <i>Das Kapital</i>, writes that "the increasing intensity 
  of work presupposes an increased expenditure of labor-power within the same 
  period of time. Therefore, a more intensive work journey is translated into 
  a greater amount of product than a less intensive journey of the same duration 
  ... the same work journey generates a greater quantity of products".<sup>7</sup> 
  In other words, the intensity of work is related to a greater amount of the 
  product of work in the same amount of time. As a consequence of this reading, 
  we chose to add, in parentheses, the sentence "(that is, produce a lot in little 
  time)", absent in the original.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The item 
  most difficult to translate, in the evaluators' opinion was the expression 'conflicting 
  demands'. The first option considered was to translate it by using the terms 
  <i>'conflitante'</i> ('conflicting') or <i>'contradit&oacute;rias'</i> 
  ('contradictory'). These terms were considered as confusing during pre-testing 
  and probing. Our final choice was to include the phrase <i>'exig&ecirc;ncias 
  contradit&oacute;rias ou discordantes'</i> ('contradictory or discordant demands').</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The translators 
  disagreed as to certain items of the 'social support' dimension (A). For example, 
  the phrase 'if I am having a bad day', considered as difficult to translate, 
  had to undergo special probing. When translated literally, it asked if other 
  people were understanding when the worker was having a '<i>mau dia</i>' ('bad 
  day'). According to the respondents, this expression was not well regarded in 
  our culture, as if the simple mention of the expression could bring bad luck. 
  The interviewees suggested its substitution for the phrase '<i>n&atilde;o estar 
  num bom dia'</i> ('not having a good day'), which was accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">During the 
  probing stage, subjects made suggestions for more adequate versions of the eight 
  questions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Measurement 
  equivalence</i> results are presented in <a href="#tab1">Tables 1</a> and <a href="#tab2">2</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> presents the results of answer stability in the test-retest study, which 
  varied between 0.82 and 0.91, considering each dimension separately. As to the 
  subdimensions, 'authority for making decisions' had the highest level of stability 
  among men and women (0.70 and 0.54, respectively). Generally speaking, men showed 
  greater stability in their answers than women, albeit this difference was not 
  statistically significant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Internal 
  consistency values (Cronbach's alpha) ranged from 0.63 to 0.86 (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). As to the subdimensions, the lowest values registered were for 'intellectual 
  discerning' (0.57 for men and 0.55 for women).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 
  the conceptual equivalence of the terms <i>'estresse'</i> and <i>'trabalho'</i> 
  in both languages, we cannot fail to consider, when analyzing the results of 
  the empirical survey of stress in the workplace and health-related outcomes, 
  the different forms of labor organization – including the different degrees 
  of technological advancement, the importance of social rights, and the degree 
  of organization of workers – as well as the general living conditions in the 
  countries where the scale was used (Sweden and Brazil).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout 
  the different stages of the adaptation process, we were able to progress towards 
  the obtainment of item, semantic, and operational equivalence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internal 
  consistency of the questions surpassed the minimum level proposed by Rowland 
  (0.70) in the demand and social support dimensions. It fell somewhat below this 
  threshold in the control dimension. No expressive difference was found between 
  men and women, except in the 'demand' dimension and in the 'decision latitude' 
  subdimension, where vales for women were higher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A comparison 
  of the internal consistency values found in the study population to those estimated 
  by Theorell<sup>13</sup> for Swedish workers (men and women in samples from 
  the general population) shows that, in both populations, the lowest levels of 
  consistency were found in relation to the 'intellectual discerning' subdimension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Josephson 
  et al<sup>4</sup> used the same scale in Sweden – including only the demand 
  and control dimensions – and found Cronbach's Alpha coefficients of 0.69 and 
  0.51 for each of these dimensions respectively. These values were considered 
  low by the authors. Values in the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> Study were 
  higher (0.72 and 0.63, respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  obtained until now allow us to consider the existence of <i>measurement</i> 
  <i>equivalence</i> between the two versions of the scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to the adaptation scheme proposed by Herdman,<sup>3</sup> upon reaching the 
  five previous types of equivalence, the scale can be considered as equivalent 
  to the original version from the <i>functional</i> point of view.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>**</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The adapted 
  version of the job stress scale will allow for the investigation of associations 
  between job stress and a number of health-related outcomes in Brazilian studies. 
  The <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> Study, for example, will include an investigation 
  of the association of arterial hypertension (based on the measurements performed) 
  with job stress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The adapted 
  scale does not contemplate all aspects inherent to the workplace environment. 
  The authors of the scale never had the pretension of covering this totality, 
  and explicitly stated so.<sup>5</sup> The scale allows us, however, to explore 
  certain dimensions of stress in this specific environment, which may be complemented 
  by the use of other scales and by qualitative studies.</font></p>
