<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Low visual acuity (VA) is an important public health problem due to its 
  high prevalence and because it needs early diagnosis in order to prevent damage 
  in childhood development and apprenticeship. To describe and analyze low visual 
  acuity (VA) prevalence among school children<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Once performed the VA test to 1st and 4th grades primary school 
  children data were analyzed by separating students according to sex, school 
  grade, wearing of glasses, residence area and level of access to the supplementary 
  medical assistance (SMA).<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The total of 9,640 students was evaluated during the year of 
  2000 and they presented a prevalence of low VA of 13.1% (CI 12.5-13.8%). There 
  was a statistical significant lower prevalence in males (11.5%) compared to 
  females (14.9%) - (PR=0.77). There was a statistical significant higher prevalence 
  in 1st grade students (14.1%) compared to 4th grade (11.5%) - (PR=1.22). There 
  was also a statistical significant lower prevalence for those who were not wearing 
  glasses (12.1%) compared to those who were using glasses (42.0%) - (PR=0.29). 
  Concerning to residence areas, Cajuru neighborhood had the lower prevalence 
  of low VA (1.8%) and Vila Sabia neighborhood had the higher prevalence (32.4%), 
  and a positive correlation, according to residence area, between the proportion 
  of people with access to the Supplementary Medical Assistance and the proportion 
  of children wearing glasses was found (r=0.64, p&lt;0.001).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The low VA high prevalence shows lack in early diagnosis 
  and continuity of assistance pointing out to the urgent need of implementation 
  in visual health public.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Vision is 
  the primary means of integration between individual and external environment, 
  and knowledge is to a great extent acquired visually. Visual problems have negative 
  effects on learning and social interaction, thus affecting the natural development 
  of intellectual, academic, professional, and social abilities.<sup>15</sup> 
  Several authors recognize the association between adequate academic performance 
  and good visual health.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data from 
  international studies<sup>11</sup> show that approximately 25% of school-age 
  children carry some form of visual deficiency. However, are unlikely to report 
  such problems to relatives or teachers.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  surveys have demonstrated the importance of the early diagnosis of visual problems 
  as an essential means of minimizing and preventing severe problems in the future, 
  including amblyopia and strabismus.<sup>6</sup> In developing countries, the 
  scenario is even more worrisome: data show that 80% of blindness cases worldwide 
  occur in these countries, and that two-thirds of these cases are either preventable 
  or curable.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  public health perspective, mass investigation of visual problems in children 
  by ophthalmologists is too costly, which suggests the administration of visual 
  acuity tests by non-physicians, as long as trained and supervised. This is the 
  recommended procedure when dealing with populations clustered into schools, 
  within the age group in which visual problems are a priority.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Routine 
  visual acuity evaluation is aimed at ensuring good visual health, helping to 
  attenuate the high rates of school dropout and academic failure, and preventing 
  several more important visual complications.<sup>14</sup> Thus, visual acuity 
  screening programs in schools are directed towards the identification of children 
  in need of ophthalmologic care.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the municipality 
  of Sorocaba, southeastern Brazil, such screening has been accomplished by the 
  <i>Programa Escola Saud&aacute;vel</i> (Healthy School Program - PES). This 
  program provides counseling by a healthcare team to maternities, day care centers, 
  pre-schools, and elementary schools for the promotion of health and the prevention 
  of diseases. Its activities include, among others, actions directed to Hygiene, 
  Nutrition, and Mental, Oral, and Visual Health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  collective health standpoint, to describe and analyze the prevalence of low 
  visual acuity in schoolchildren as diagnosed by healthcare agents may be of 
  great value for the planning and improvement of preventive measures and for 
  the establishment of local visual healthcare programs, capable of reducing the 
  inequity existent in contemporary Brazilian healthcare, reported by various 
  authors.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the 
  present study's general goal is to describe the prevalence of low visual acuity 
  among elementary school students.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  was conducted with first- and fourth-grade students form elementary schools 
  of the public network in Sorocaba, southeastern Brazil. LVA diagnosis was performed 
  on 9.640 schoolchildren.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  was carried out in two separate stages. The first of these was carried out in 
  2000 by School Healthcare Agents of the <i>Programa Escola Saud&aacute;vel</i>. 
  These agents evaluated the visual acuity of 1st and 4th grade students from 
  municipal and state elementary schools. The exam was carried out after parental/caretaker 
  consent was obtained through School Administration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Evaluation 
  was performed using a Snellen chart (whose scores vary between 0.1 and 1.0). 
  The child was placed five meters away from the chart, and optotypes were indicated 
  using a black pencil placed vertically two centimeters below the character, 
  as recommended by the <i>Conselho Brasileiro de Oftalmologia</i> (Brazilian 
  Ophthalmology Council). Each eye was examined separately. Children who wore 
  eyeglasses were examined with their eyeglasses appropriately placed. Children 
  who recognized Snellen line 3 optotypes (VA=0.8) with both eyes were considered 
  as having normal visual acuity. Children who did not recognize this line – with 
  one or both eyes – were classified as with LVA.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data from 
  each classroom were registered in a file, including student's name, grade and 
  VA values for each eye. Students who had difficulty reading the table were referred 
  to ophthalmologists at the Sorocaba Ophthalmologic Hospital.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the second 
  stage (2001-2002), the results recorded in the visual screening files were analyzed. 
  The number of school children who underwent the test was recorded, as well as 
  the number of LVA children (one or both eyes). These data were grouped initially 
  by school, and then by Health Center reference area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Children 
  absent at the day of the test, whose names or scores were not legible written 
  on the files, who's sex could not be defined based on the records, or who could 
  not take the test, despite being willing to do so, due to comprehension problems, 
  were excluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Children 
  were classified according to visual acuity (normal (VA=0.8) or low (VA&lt;0.8), 
  sex, grade (1st and 4th) and use of eyeglasses (yes/no).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The proportion 
  of subjects with access to supplementary healthcare in a given reference area 
  was estimated based on the proportion of deliveries in the area performed by 
  the SHC system (which includes direct procedure payment and health plans or 
  insurance) in 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Relative 
  Risk (Prevalence Ratio) of LVA was calculated between sexes (male/female), grades 
  (1st/4th) and use of eyeglasses (yes/no).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Pearson's 
  correlation test was performed for the distribution of variables "access to 
  supplementary healthcare", "use of eyeglasses", and "low visual acuity" by reference 
  area. In case a correlation was significant, a Linear Regression analysis was 
  carried out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data analysis 
  was carried out using Epi Info v.6.04d and Bioestat 2.0 software.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis 
  included 47 public network schools and 19 private schools, located within the 
  reference areas of 26 Health Centers, covering 100% of the municipality of Sorocaba, 
  southeastern Brazil. The 4th grade schools evaluated were located in 19 Health 
  Center areas, covering 73.1% of the municipality. The 1st grade schools were 
  located in all 26 areas, that is, 100% of the municipality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to the number of students enrolled in the schools included in the visual screening, 
  a total 10,982 students should have been evaluated. This did not happen in practice, 
  however, due to the large number of absences registered on the day of the test 
  (1,307 students, 11.9%). Furthermore, 7 students whose sex could not be determined 
  based on the examination file, 14 whose names or test results were illegible, 
  and 14 who were not able to take the test were excluded from the second stage 
  of the study, totalizing 1,342 losses (12.2%). Thus the second stage of the 
  study included information on 9,640 students, of which 1,266 had low visual 
  acuity (13.1% prevalence, 95% CI 12.5-13.8%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 9,640 
  students evaluated, 4,921 (51.0%) were male and 4,719 (49.0%) female. Prevalence 
  of LVA was 11.5% among male students (95% IC 10.6-12.4%), and 14.9% among female 
  students (95% CI 13.9-15.9%). The prevalence ratio for male students was 0.77 
  (95% CI =0.69-0.85) (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">First-graders 
  accounted for 63.4% of the sample (6,109 students), and fourth-graders for 36.6% 
  (3,531 students). Prevalence of LVA was 14.1% among first-graders (95% CI 13.2-15.0%) 
  and 11.5% among fourth-graders (95% CI 10.5-12.6%). The prevalence ratio for 
  first graders was 1.22 (95% CI 1.10-1.37).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the total 
  9,640 students analyzed, 348 (3,6%) wore eyeglasses. Of these, 146 had visual 
  acuity below 0.8 even with their eyeglasses appropriately placed (42.0% prevalence, 
  95% CI 36.7-47.3%). Of the 9,292 students who did not wear eyeglasses, 1.120 
  had VA&lt;0.8 (12.1% prevalence, 95% CI 11.4-12.7%). The prevalence ratio for 
  students without eyeglasses was 0.29 (95% CI 0.25-0.33).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">LVA prevalence 
  ranged, according to reference area, from 1.8% in <i>Cajur&uacute;</i> to 32.4% 
  in <i>Vila Sabi&aacute;</i>; the proportion of subjects with access to supplementary 
  healthcare varied between 0.13 in <i>Lopes de Oliveira</i> and <i>Nova Esperan&ccedil;a</i> 
  and 0.49 in <i>Vila Santana</i>; and the prevalence of eyeglasses ranged from 
  1.3% in <i>Eden</i> to 9.8% in <i>Vila Santana</i>. No significant correlation 
  was observed between LVA and access to SHC (r=-0.0476; p=0.8174), nor between 
  LVA and use of eyeglasses (r=0.2097; p=0.3039). However, a significant correlation 
  was observed between use of eyeglasses and access to SHC (r=0.6376; p=0.005)

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Situation 
  in Sorocaba</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of low visual acuity among 1st and 4th grade students found in the present study 
  was 13.1%. There are few studies in the literature including students from these 
  two grades only, which limits the validity of comparisons. Moreover, many studies 
  have different methodologies. Most studies use the visual acuity test only as 
  a preliminary exam for the selection of subjects for more detailed examination. 
  Still, we have managed to compare our data to those of other somewhat similar 
  studies. The prevalence of LVA among studies similar to ours varied from 7.6 
  to 29%.<sup>1,7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A comparison 
  of the LVA prevalence found in Sorocaba and those from the aforementioned studies 
  places Sorocaba in an intermediate position. This does not mean that Sorocaba 
  students have good visual health, for the 13.1% prevalence found is potentially 
  reducible. Despite being less than half the value of the highest prevalence 
  found (29%),<sup>7</sup> the prevalence in Sorocaba is still almost twice the 
  lowest value (7.6%).<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The number 
  of students absent on the day of the test (11.9%) must be considered when discussing 
  the prevalence of LVA found in the present study. Such a high rate of absenteeism 
  will led to a underestimation of actual levels in case a larger proportion of 
  LVA individuals is included among the absentees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Two studies 
  help us understand factors that may have led to the large number of absentees 
  registered.<sup>10,4</sup> In a study carried out in the city of Osasco (southeastern 
  Brazil), 2,238 of the 2,280 enrolled students were tested, a 1.84 absentee rate.<sup>10</sup> 
  However, this evaluation included a prior effort directed towards increasing 
  family awareness and pedagogically preparing the target population; teachers 
  were instructed to develop means of raising the students' interest in the test 
  through games and recreational activities. The <i>Oftalmologia Sanit&aacute;ria</i> 
  project<sup>4</sup> found that a large number of children did not come to school 
  on the day of the test. A large number absences was registered throughout the 
  entire length of the project, and the authors suggest that, since the absent 
  children belonged to low purchasing-power classes, socioeconomic factors might 
  have contributed towards such high absenteeism. This could be explained by the 
  lack of information and interest in matters related to education observed among 
  poorer classes, which combine with the health-related problems characteristic 
  of these populations, such as malnutrition and the consequent increase in disease 
  incidence, to prevent school attendance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">On the other 
  hand, the low specificity of this form of diagnosis may have contributed towards 
  an overestimation of the prevalence in Sorocaba. In a 1989 study,<sup>4</sup> 
  the number of false-positives reached 63.4% of students referred to more detailed 
  examination after visual acuity screening. In this study, the high incidence 
  of false-positive outcomes may be explained by a certain level of insecurity 
  observed among volunteer screeners, who, in case of doubt, refer the student 
  to ophthalmologic examination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The use 
  of a =0.8 visual acuity level as a referral criterion yields 17 false-positives 
  for every 3 false-negatives. However, if a =0.7 visual acuity cutoff point is 
  employed (as in the present study), this relationship shifts to 9 false-positives 
  for every 6 false-negatives.<sup>14</sup> This corroborates the hypothesis that 
  the prevalence of LVA found in the municipality of Sorocaba may be an overestimate, 
  since, even though there is a certain level of compensation, false-positives 
  still exceed false-negatives in 50%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If the cutoff 
  point were VA=0.8, the number of false-positives would be more than twice the 
  number found when using the AV=0.7 threshold, generating a costly exaggeration 
  in terms of public health planning. A VA=0.5 cutoff point would generate an 
  almost threefold increase in the number of false-negatives (the main error to 
  be avoided in this type of program). Thus, the VA=0.7 threshold seems to be 
  the most adequate.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An alternative 
  for reducing the prevalence of LVA in Sorocaba would be the implementation of 
  sanitary ophthalmology projects among non-school-age children (or preschool 
  children) who seek medical care with pediatricians from the municipal healthcare 
  network. Most forms of amblyopia do not respond to treatment after age 6-7 years, 
  resulting in permanent visual deficiency. In addition, at age 7 years most children 
  are already passed the age when best therapeutic results can be obtained for 
  refraction problems associated with strabismus and amblyopia.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
  such proposal may be hampered by pediatricians' lack of knowledge of ophthalmologic 
  problems in children and newborn.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, the number of pediatricians 
  who do not perform ophthalmologic exams on their patients is also high. Only 
  20% of pediatricians perform routine evaluations in newborn babies, and 64% 
  do not perform any routine examinations on infants. Thus, training these professionals 
  is a necessary step, since survey results indicate that 25.4% of pediatricians 
  consider it unnecessary to verify the vision of children below school age.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  specialists emphasize the importance of early detection of ocular problems in 
  infants, pre-school children, and first-grade children as one of the most effective 
  measures for the prevention of visual deficiencies.<sup>1,10,14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Relationship 
  between LVA and gender</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study found a significant difference in the prevalence of low visual acuity 
  between sexes; LVA prevalence was greater among girls (14.9%) than among boys 
  (11.5%). This is probably due to the greater frequency suggested for ocular 
  diseases among females. This hypothesis is corroborated by a study carried out 
  in 1994, in which 217 children with visual deficiencies were found in a screening 
  of 1,397 students aged 5-17 years. Of these 217 subjects selected for a more 
  detailed examination, 149 (69%) were females, and 68 (31%), males. After ophthalmologic 
  examination, of the 135 students with some sort of refraction problem, 94 (70%) 
  were female and 41 (30%) were male.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data from 
  a study conducted by the <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Deficientes 
  Visuais</i> (Brazilian Visual Deficient Association) in 98 municipalities of 
  Northeastern Brazil<sup>15</sup> also supports this hypothesis. This study found 
  a predominance of females (62.6%) when compared to males (37.4%) among subjects 
  with visual impairment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Relation 
  between LVA and grade</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study found a greater prevalence of LVA among 1st grade students when compared 
  to 4th graders. This difference maintained itself even when the comparison was 
  restricted to the 19 areas with data registered for both grades (data not shown).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This may 
  be a result of the low academic achievement of students with ophthalmologic 
  impairment, who, unable to keep up with other students, would be transferred 
  to special classes (the so-called 'acceleration classes'). When first-graders 
  are evaluated, those with ophthalmologic problems are included in the evaluation, 
  since there has not been enough time for the teacher to identify these students' 
  academic shortcomings. However, when evaluating the visual acuity of fourth-graders, 
  students with poor academic standings were not evaluated, for the period between 
  1st and 4th grades gives teachers enough time to identify any academic achievement 
  problems and thus to refer students to the 'acceleration classes'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This hypothesis 
  is supported by a including 270 low-achievement students, which concluded, by 
  means of ophthalmologic exams, that only 50 (19.5%) satisfied all criteria for 
  being considered as 'normal'.<sup>6</sup> According to the authors, this is 
  equivalent to saying that 80.5% of subjects in this sample could have their 
  academic shortcomings explained by low visual acuity or refraction problems. 
  It should be emphasized that a large number of children labeled as incapable 
  – many of which are referred to 'special classes' – may actually be suffering 
  from refraction problems.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
  hypothesis is that 4th graders are at a higher level of psychomotor development, 
  and thus are capable of better understanding the explanations preceding the 
  test, and hence achieving better test results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
  since 4th graders are obviously older – around age 10 years –, it is expected 
  that they have already been submitted to the Snellen test in other occasions, 
  and perform better due to their familiarity with the table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The hypothesis 
  that prevalence is lower among fourth-graders because of adequate care and correction 
  of visual acuity by the use of corrective lenses can be discarded, since, as 
  we pointed out in the results section, and will further discuss in the section 
  below, the prevalence of LVA is greater among eyeglass wearers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Relation 
  between LVA and use/nonuse of eyeglasses</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of low visual acuity was higher among eyeglass wearers (42.0%) when compared 
  to non-wearers (12.1%). This may be related to a lack of follow-up and updating 
  of the prescription lenses worn by children. The unfavorable economic scenario 
  and the lack of complaints from the child or of observation by parents and teachers 
  may account for the insufficient correction provided by lenses worn by children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In a study 
  carried out in 1979, of the 564 schoolchildren evaluated, 52 wore optical correction. 
  After ophthalmologic evaluation, 12 eyeglasses (23.8%) were maintained, 18 (34.6%) 
  were updated, and 22 (42.8%) were removed. Furthermore, of the remaining students, 
  55 required optical correction.<sup>8</sup> In a study carried out with pre-school 
  children,<sup>5</sup> of the five eyeglass wearers selected for further examination, 
  3 (60%) had their prescriptions updated. These data support the results found 
  in the present study, since the majority of eyeglass wearers required prescription 
  updating, or even removal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It would 
  be appropriate that all children, when they are enrolling in 1st grade, undergo 
  ophthalmologic examinations, or, at least, have their visual acuity measured.<sup>14</sup> 
  But this is not enough. It seems to us inadequate to promote a visual health 
  program for children one year – 1st grade – and not to provide follow-up in 
  subsequent years, since the optical correction provided may cease to fulfill 
  the child's needs, or even, in certain cases, become hazardous to the child's 
  health. A minimal goal for visual health programs should be to perform visual 
  evaluations at ages 4, 7 and 13 years.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis 
  of LVA prevalence according to reference area was not related to access to supplementary 
  healthcare. As an initial hypothesis, this may be related to shortcomings in 
  this sector in terms of diagnosis and treatment. The hypothesis of treatment 
  failure is supported by the absence of a correlation between LVA and use of 
  eyeglasses, a result consistent with that of the association analysis between 
  use of eyeglasses and LVA, which indicated a greater risk of LVA among wearers, 
  already discussed above. However, we wish to emphasize that the data indicate 
  that treatment failure does not occur only among students who depend on the 
  public network, but also among those with access to supplementary healthcare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">On the other 
  hand, the significant positive correlation between access to supplementary healthcare 
  and use of eyeglasses indicates that early diagnosis is lacking especially for 
  the share of the population that depends on the public network, which demonstrates 
  yet another facet of the inequities in Brazilian healthcare. Even assuming a 
  likely classification bias in the "access to supplementary healthcare" variable, 
  given that this information was determined based on an indirect indicator, its 
  most probable effect would be the weakening of the correlation. Furthermore, 
  if we assume that LVA cases are more prevalent and severer among social groups 
  with worse socioeconomic conditions, we could argue that the actual correlation 
  should be stronger than that registered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study indicates the existence of shortcomings in the early diagnosis of low 
  visual acuity, as evidenced by the high prevalence registered among students 
  without eyeglasses. It also suggests that such shortcomings are especially prejudicial 
  to those without access to supplementary healthcare, and points towards a poor 
  continuity of ophthalmologic care, as evidenced by the high prevalence of LVA 
  among eyeglass wearers due to the inadequacy of their corrective lenses. Therefore, 
  the implementation of a public visual health program is urgent, necessary, and 
  imperative if a reduction of the negative consequences of LVA prevalence is 
  to be achieved.</font></p>
