<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To recognize the significance of fetal loss for women who have experienced 
  it, starting from an understanding of the pregnancy process, based on their 
  reports.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This was a qualitative analysis study based on the histories 
  of seven women who experienced fetal loss in the town of Aruj&aacute;, State 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo, between July 1998 and June 1999. The women were identified 
  from the death certificates of stillborn infants born within the study period, 
  which were obtained from the Civil Registry Office of Aruj&aacute;. The methodological 
  procedures involved the utilization of the techniques of oral history-taking 
  to gather data and content analysis to evaluate the material collected. The 
  interviews were recorded, fully transcribed and subsequently prepared for analysis.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The findings were analyzed as two points: the circumstantial 
  context of the pregnancy and the impact after the loss, with the adoption of 
  specific thematic categories. The first of these encompassed the woman's perception 
  of the pregnancy, her awareness of the coming of the new baby, health problems 
  up to the time of the loss, and the health service attendance. The significance 
  of the loss for the women in this study was made evident along three central 
  lines: the loss of a part of herself, attribution of the fatality to divine 
  intervention and changes in attitude towards life. The social support network 
  for these women was built on two pillars: family and church. Support from the 
  health services was practically nonexistent. Finally, they all expressed their 
  will to live and the need to work, study and even have another pregnancy.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> There needs to be a change in general concepts in the mission 
  to attend to such women. The attendance provided by the healthcare services 
  needs to be humanized. The need for multiprofessional follow-up of healthcare 
  service users who suffered fetal loss was very evident. The importance of a 
  support network for women who have gone through this problem was also shown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The majority 
  of scientific work on the subject of fetal loss, within the field of public 
  health, has involved population or single-institution studies. These have taken 
  a quantitative approach along classical lines, seeking to investigate the biological 
  causes and the social or psychosocial risk factors that are associated with 
  fetal loss. In essence, these studies have considered the problem of fetal loss 
  from the viewpoint of an outsider trying to discover the factors that may have 
  influenced this occurrence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There have 
  also been some studies performed medical school obstetric clinics that were 
  undertaken with a qualitative approach towards women who suffered fetal or perinatal 
  loss while interned (Luz et al,<sup>9</sup> 1989; Popim et al,<sup>14</sup> 
  1990; Martins et al,<sup>10</sup> 1998). These studies were linked to preoccupations 
  within nursing, psychological and medical attendance for comprehension of the 
  genesis and dynamics of the mothers' feelings when faced with fetal or perinatal 
  loss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Bogdan &amp; Biklen<sup>4</sup> (1982), in qualitative methodology, the researcher 
  should especially focus on the significance that people give to events and their 
  lives. In the opinion of Meihy<sup>11</sup> (1998), the basis for an oral history 
  is the recorded testimony and, according to Denzin<sup>8</sup> (1973), the oral 
  history presents the experiences and definitions that a person lives through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Minayo<sup>12</sup> 
  (1994) considered that "content analysis is the method most frequently utilized 
  in the field of healthcare for undertaking the data treatment of a qualitative 
  investigation" and, according to Bardin<sup>2</sup> (1977), "thematic analysis 
  consists of discovering the core meaning that makes up a communication, and 
  the presence or frequency of such meaning may signify something within the chosen 
  analytical objective" (p.105).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With the 
  aim of contributing towards deepening the knowledge of this matter, the present 
  study had the objective of obtaining a comprehension of fetal loss through the 
  eyes of those who have suffered the experience: having gone through the process 
  of pregnancy within the context of their lives, confronting problems of various 
  kinds, they ended up losing their children and afterwards suffered the consequences 
  of this loss.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This was 
  a qualitative study performed in the municipality of Aruj&aacute;, State of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo. The subjects for the study were identified from the death 
  certificates of stillborn infants born between July 1998 and June 1999, which 
  were obtained from the Civil Registry Office of the municipality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  was to comprehend these women's perceptions within their real circumstances 
  of having gone through the problem of losing their babies. For this, certain 
  initial questions were put to them, and these questions informed the whole investigative 
  process:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    How did the woman realize she was pregnant?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    What were the alterations felt in her body?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    How was the news that she was going to have a baby received?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    When and how did she seek out the healthcare services?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    What were the circumstances of the loss of the baby?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    What reactions did the woman have, following the loss?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    What significance did the loss of the baby have, in the context of her life?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Out of the 
  total of fifteen women identified, eleven were located. Of these eleven women, 
  seven were interviewed while four were not. The reasons why these four were 
  not interviewed were the following: two did not show up at the agreed location, 
  even though they had been visited at home three times; one moved away from Aruj&aacute; 
  after being located; and one did not agree to participate in the interview. 
  The interviews were held in the women's homes, after they signed a statement 
  of consent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data collection 
  was performed by means of the <i>oral history-taking technique</i> and the reports 
  from the interviews with the women were analyzed by means of the <i>content 
  analysis technique</i> and, in particular, <i>thematic analysis</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
  two stages cited by Bardin<sup>2</sup> (1977) were utilized for the thematic 
  analysis, i.e. pre-analysis and exploration of the material. The interviews 
  were recorded and then fully transcribed, with correction of the Portuguese. 
  To obtain a text for analysis, the transcription rules from Preti<sup>15</sup> 
  (1997) were utilized. The thematic categories for the study were selected subsequently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
  analysis, two points in the process experienced by these women were chosen. 
  These were named the circumstantial context of the pregnancy and the impact 
  after the loss.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#151; Circumstantial 
  context of the pregnancy: for this, the reports of the pregnancy process up 
  to the time of loss were considered, including the attendance for the delivery, 
  utilizing the following categories:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the woman's realization that she was pregnant;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the coming of the baby;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    health problems up to the time of the loss;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the attendance by the healthcare services.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#151; Impact 
  after the loss: for this, the reports of the process experienced by the women 
  after the loss were considered, from the time of their arrival back home without 
  the baby, until the time of the interview, utilizing the following categories:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the reactions presented;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the memories of the baby;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    the significance of the loss;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    social support networks;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    messages for other women;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    prospects.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Profiles 
  of the women and analysis of their histories</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews 
  were held with seven women who suffered fetal loss, between four and thirteen 
  months after the loss of the baby. From their sociodemographic profiles, the 
  interviewees belonged to lower social classes. They were aged between 17 and 
  38 years; five had a stable partner and two were single (no partner). They had 
  all become pregnant without prior planning, and therefore the pregnancy had 
  an unexpected character. Six of them had previously had one or more pregnancies, 
  and this was the first pregnancy for only one of the women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
  analysis point – the circumstantial circumstances of the pregnancy – was obtained 
  by recalling the circumstances that surrounded the process for these women, 
  from the moment they realized they were pregnant until the loss, including the 
  attendance for the delivery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The women 
  realized that they were pregnant at around three months of gestation in six 
  cases, and in the remaining case (an adolescent), it was at five months of gestation. 
  For three of the women the diagnosis was given by a doctor. From the time of 
  confirmation of the pregnancy, all these women underwent prenatal examinations, 
  mostly in public healthcare services. <i>"I was three months pregnant, so I 
  had to face up to this situation."</i> (Ane)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
  other four women, the realization that they were pregnant came from the presence 
  of evident symptoms such as late menstruation, changes in the body, nausea and 
  headaches. In this group, the realization came earlier – at around three months 
  of gestation – and was by the women themselves. <i>"It was easy to realize, 
  because for me &#91;my period&#93; is never late, and it was a week late, so it was 
  a sign of pregnancy."</i> (Marilsa).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the analysis 
  of the second category (the coming of the baby) two opposing reactions were 
  observed: on the one hand happiness, and on the other hand, rejection<i>. "They 
  were six and a half months of great joy, you know, because to discover I was 
  pregnant after so long&#133; I was happy, really I was happy."</i> (Mariana)<i>.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the other 
  group of women, whose reaction was rejection, the circumstances of life that 
  surrounded them at that time could be recognized from their histories. For them, 
  pregnancy did not appear to have been something they wanted. <i>"I was desperate, 
  I told myself it couldn't be pregnancy."</i> (Ane)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was very 
  striking in this group that, despite the initial feeling of rejection that was 
  common to all of them, the most dramatic reactions were presented by the single 
  women, which may be a reiteration of the cultural, social, historical and affective 
  meaning of pregnancy and the symbolic meaning of marriage, as revealed in the 
  studies by Paim<sup>13</sup> (1998) and Brioshi &amp; Trigo<sup>6</sup> (1989).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is worth 
  emphasizing that no subject in the present study reported a desire to have an 
  abortion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 
  the initial rejection, all the women subsequently shouldered the burden of the 
  pregnancy, according to their reports. This may also be an expression, from 
  a sociocultural point of view, of the value placed on the role of being a mother, 
  as a fundamental component of female identity, which was well defined by Stasevskas<sup>18</sup> 
  (1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the category 
  of health problems prior to the loss, the women in the study detailed the process 
  leading up to the outcome, highlighting health problems that they had to face 
  up to. <i>"It's just that what happened was&#133; when I was six and a half 
  months pregnant, I started to realize that really I was very fat; I saw that 
  my feet had started to swell. I came here to the emergency service&#133; the 
  doctor said that I needed to take the medicine</i> &#91;Aldomet&#93;<i>, because I had 
  high pressure... when I told my gynecologist that the baby wasn't moving, he 
  interned me immediately."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This report 
  gives an idea of health problems perceived during the pregnancy that led the 
  women to seek healthcare services. The evolution of the health problems described 
  allows the recognition of two sequential points in time: the first, when the 
  evident symptoms were swelling, pains in the legs, bleeding, fever, pain, dizziness 
  and vomiting; and the second, when most of the women said they had realized 
  that the baby had stopped moving.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For these 
  women, this realization that the baby had stopped moving was the crucial moment 
  of death of their children. This occurred between the second and third three-month 
  period of the pregnancy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The correct 
  description of symptoms could be recognized from the reports given by the interviewees. 
  In some cases, these symptoms preceded the medical diagnosis of the loss of 
  the baby. These data put into question the myth that people of low income belonging 
  to low social classes are incapable of correctly communicating their symptoms 
  and understanding diagnostic explanations. Such reasoning is alleged by many 
  healthcare professionals to justify not giving out information correctly to 
  service users under these conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to the category of attendance by the healthcare services, the reports reveal 
  that all the women in the study mentioned that they underwent prenatal examinations 
  as soon as the pregnancy was confirmed. They were all attended by the public 
  healthcare services, except for one woman who utilized a private health scheme 
  service. For the majority of the women, prenatal care began at around three 
  months of gestation, and it began at five months for only one woman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The women's 
  words give evidence of serious criticism of the quality of prenatal attendance 
  received in some cases: <i>"Now, speaking like this about doctors&#133; I think 
  the prenatal care isn't very good&#133; I think it needs improvement. I notice 
  these things, I went through all this, and who wouldn't notice? I did two prenatal 
  tests and, well, I think that the high pressure, this business of the</i> &#91;high-risk&#93; 
  <i>pregnant woman just once a month, I think it's not right. I think it should 
  be once a week&#133; I think, because it really needs care, like in that poster 
  saying that pregnancy requires care."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Others directed 
  their complaints towards the quality of prenatal consultations, particularly 
  the lack of adequate physical examination during the consultation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to hospital attendance, they referred to the disorganization of the hospital, 
  in relation to family members seeking information about the situation of patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
  other criticisms in the reports, regarding doctors' attitudes, especially concerning 
  the doctor-patient relationship and the attendance within the hospital environment. 
  In the women's testimonies, they attribute blame and responsibility to the doctors 
  who attended to them, in relation to the procedures accompanying the delivery, 
  as in the following: <i>"I just thought he was very cold, because for a doctor, 
  OK, the doctor doesn't have to be cold, but not to the point of going up to 
  the mother and saying: 'we're going to take out your baby because it's dead'&#133; 
  I don't think it's right like that, no. I could even blame the doctor, but&#133; 
  there's no point in blaming something because I've got no proof, I can't say 
  it was just his mistake&#133; I did my bit, when he kept me in hospital, I think 
  he had to do something, he knew the baby was dying&#133; and I was expecting 
  to have normal contractions&#133; like always. Not everything's normal&#133; 
  not all deliveries are the same. I thought he would have to do a cesarean, taking 
  the baby out earlier."</i> (Marilsa)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to the hospital attendance, side-by-side with the criticisms, some women (Ros&acirc;ngela 
  and Cristina) had praise for the nurses and doctors. <i>"The one who released 
  me from hospital was my doctor, he passed by on the next day and released me. 
  I asked them to call him, because I did the prenatal tests with him, and he 
  explained everything: it didn't work out this time, you've got to keep calm, 
  you're going to get another baby and so on, he said the right things to me like 
  that. He said that the baby was very young, six months, it's difficult&#133; 
  because the little lungs are still green&#133;"</i> (Cristina)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Defey et 
  al<sup>7</sup> (1985) showed that the confirmation of fetal loss is experienced 
  by doctors and nurses as a failure of medicine, which produces a feeling of 
  frustration and impotence because of their difficulty in controlling the situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to the criticisms directed towards the prenatal care and hospital attendance, 
  there was also questioning of the healthcare services regarding the lack of 
  follow-up after delivery in cases of loss of the baby. <i>"You know, I don't 
  have anyone to accuse of anything&#133; because I know I wasn't well. And another 
  thing that's very important&#133; the pregnant woman after the pregnancy. Hey, 
  guys, how important that is after the delivery! In my case, for example, I had 
  no support - none. This is what I think&#133; the family must be prepared, given 
  advice for such, such a situation. I think that a comforting place, she really 
  needs it."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The majority 
  of the attendance by the healthcare services frequented by these women revealed 
  the asymmetry of the doctor-patient relationship during the consultation, in 
  concordance with the study by Boltanski<sup>5</sup> (1979). According to this 
  study, the guidance for patients becomes less significant, the lower the patient's 
  social stratum is, with the justification that low-stratum patients have difficulty 
  in comprehending the scientific language utilized by doctors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study contradicts this myth, as already observed earlier, through the reports 
  by these women, with the richness of detail regarding their bodies, the evolution 
  of diseases, perception of serious symptoms and knowledge of the need for supplementary 
  tests. Such facts give an indication of greater incorporation of medical knowledge 
  by the general population today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The second 
  analysis point – the impact after the loss – considered the process experienced 
  by these women from the time of the news of the loss of the baby in the hospital 
  until the time of the interview, which took place between four and thirteen 
  months after the event, as mentioned earlier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From a psychological 
  point of view, the fact the baby was stillborn represents what Defey et al<sup>7</sup> 
  (1985) called "a truncation of the natural order and a rupture of the expectations 
  placed on this project for life", implying greater difficulty for the woman 
  to accept it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reactions 
  presented by the women in the present study constituted a long pathway of suffering 
  and pain that began in the hospital, by means of the doctor's cold news, and 
  continued upon arriving back home, in being confronted by everything that would 
  have been for the baby: cradle, shawls and baby clothes. This moment was identified 
  as the time when the reality of the absence of the baby struck home. <i>"Ah, 
  it's hard to have to face up to the truth, arriving back home and seeing all 
  the baby's things, seeing the cradle made up, seeing the baby clothes&#133; 
  resting for eight months for nothing&#133; it was all in vain&#133; it makes 
  me resentful&#133; but we have to accept it&#133; it's very painful for me."</i> 
  (Marilsa)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reports 
  show that, as the woman went on becoming aware of the loss of the baby, many 
  feelings took hold of her, revealed verbally and non-verbally: frustration, 
  disappointment, resentment, sadness, guilt and tearfulness. <i>"What I want 
  to say to you&#133; in spite of&#133; the loss &#91;she cries&#93;, I still cry&#133;"</i> 
  (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to our interpretation, Mariana also reported perceived feelings of hallucination 
  and Cristina expressed the wish to die, as in the following reports: <i>"I remember 
  that, I think this is important, I remember that my whole body, it was as if 
  it had erupted into pimples&#133; and I was speaking like this to my husband: 
  do you see&#133; just look at me now&#133; at that time I needed a doctor&#133; 
  &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; I needed a tranquilizer at that moment&#133; &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; 
  nobody noticed."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"I can't 
  even explain it, just sadness&#133; even a wish to die, as well&#133; But I 
  kept my head, if not I would have done something stupid, even, God forgive me&#133; 
  losing like this&#133; I felt like wanting to die as well, together&#133;"</i> 
  (Cristina).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For most 
  of the women, the memory of the baby was expressed with the desire that it might 
  have been alive, so it could have been breast-fed, with the image that by now 
  the baby would have been some months old and already clever. For one of the 
  women, the baby was remembered as the happiness experienced during the period 
  of the pregnancy, when she already had an intuition that that would be her time 
  for happiness, according to her testimony: <i>"Because&#133; it was like this&#133; 
  six months of great joy &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; I was so happy&#133; &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; 
  It's as if he came to bring me great joy&#133; &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; and I made 
  the most of everything, everything&#133; It had been such a long time&#133; 
  just as I hadn't been to a playground&#133; and we even went to a playground&#133; 
  &#91;she cries&#93;&#133; It's as if we already knew that he wasn't going to stay&#133; 
  &#91;she cries&#93;."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">All the 
  women in the study emphasized that this loss would never be replaced by another 
  child, "the baby would never be forgotten", it was "a unique being", "very special" 
  and "while it lived it brought great joy". <i>"Well, it was hard to get used 
  to&#133; even today I remember&#133; it's as if it was today&#133; Ah&#133; 
  I don't know, I would have liked her to be here&#133; so I could have been caring 
  for her&#133; breast-feeding her&#133; I like children a lot."</i> (Alzira)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The significance 
  of the loss of the baby for the women in the study involved reflection on the 
  event and the experience they had gone through and, for the majority of them, 
  the loss was clothed in a multiplicity of meanings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  reports, we proceeded with an interpretation process based on the events that 
  occurred. This resulted in a compilation of the meanings along three lines: 
  loss of a part or piece of the body, attribution of the fatality to divine intervention 
  and changes in attitude towards life, as in the following extracts:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"For 
  me, it was part of myself that went away&#133; I don't know, but that baby was 
  part of me&#133; it was part of my life. I don't know why but, I can't explain 
  it, but&#133; For me it was an experience, a pain&#133; a hard experience, but 
  one we have to go through."</i> ( Marilsa)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"It's 
  that the baby wasn't to be mine&#133; it had to be God's&#133; God wanted things 
  like that&#133; But one He'll give me another, if He so wishes&#133; it's never 
  too late&#133;"</i> (Alzira)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"It meant 
  a lot because I've changed a lot&#133; I used to be very nervous with the boys, 
  but not now. Now I think like this: I've already lost one and I'm not going 
  to lose the others that are alive&#133;"</i> (Ane)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The 
  meaning&#133; Don't stop living, because it's very important to live. The meaning 
  of this loss was very deep&#133; because we go on finding out what our mission 
  is. Because after that pregnancy&#133; I started demanding more from myself, 
  like this&#133; I think this is the lesson it left me with. You know, we have 
  to live every minute&#133; the minute is now&#133; but responsibly. In the sense 
  that tomorrow's another day and I have to be complete&#133; so I'll be able 
  to realize all my dreams of that minute&#133; the ones from that time that's 
  passed by that I planned&#133; I can tell you that I matured with that pregnancy&#133; 
  I'm asking more of myself, I'm much more mature&#133;"</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reports 
  make it clear that there is a need for a social support network, to help such 
  women overcome an experience that is gone through with such suffering. The support 
  network that the women of the present study could count on was built on two 
  main pillars: the family and the church. The figure of the psychologist had 
  a presence that was very fleeting, as in the following reports:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"My relatives, 
  my husband, I'm evangelical, they always come to pray here&#133; My family gave 
  me a lot of support, they said I'm still young&#133; and there's time for me 
  to have another one, if I look after myself&#133; My father-in-law also gave 
  me a lot of strength&#133; he spoke of God a lot, he also taught us to put up 
  with bad things. He consoled us a lot&#133; and we're getting over it&#133;" 
  (Cristina)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"It was 
  primarily my faith in God&#133; and the pastor of my church, because he's not 
  just a pastor, he's a friend&#133; This pastor is the best person that could 
  have come into my life to help me&#133; because when I woke up in intensive 
  care, he was already there at my side, always consoling me&#133; in the best 
  possible way.. without pain&#133; without resentment, he helped me a lot. I 
  went to the psychologist, but it was my pastor who was really my psychologist&#133; 
  he was the best psychologist that God could have put into my life, it was him&#133;" 
  (Marilsa)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Faith in 
  divinity and religion, according to Assis<sup>1</sup> (1999), "brings a means 
  of understanding and explaining the world and overcoming and enduring the day-by-day 
  existence, bringing an association with hope (....), especially in situations 
  of crisis, in which life appears to be under threat".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The figure 
  of the pastor, cited by some of the women in the study, symbolizes the bridge 
  between the terrestrial and transcendental worlds. Faith, as a pledge, consoled 
  and comforted them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Marilsa 
  spoke about what a significant person who could help would be like: <i>"You 
  have to look for a friendly person who can help a lot&#133; Talking to a person 
  like this, someone with their head on straight, helps a lot&#133; it can even 
  be better than the psychologist&#133; much better&#133; the person opens up, 
  you say what you're feeling, you can cry, and this person's there to help you&#133; 
  without making you cry, you understand, helping you without your tears streaming 
  down</i>&#133;<i>"</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As a contribution 
  to the study, by way of help for other women in similar situations, the interviewees 
  left messages for other women to reflect on. For both the woman and the newborn 
  to avoid suffering, some of the women in the present study suggested that women 
  who intend to become pregnant should prepare for pregnancy by caring for their 
  bodies. The following from Mariana explains this: <i>"I have something to say 
  about everything that's happened to me&#133; the only thing I think&#133; that 
  I can ask, because everyone will ask for something. But for me, what I ask is 
  that girls prepare themselves better for pregnancy, because we need to be well&#133; 
  the body needs to be strong&#133; it needs to be healthy. I know it's very difficult 
  like this for someone&#133; to know how to prepare for pregnancy&#133; but I 
  think it's necessary&#133; because the baby suffers a lot&#133; when we aren't 
  ready for this pregnancy&#133; because I feel I wasn't&#133; because&#133; I 
  was so swollen&#133; so swollen&#133; my face became round, my eyes disappeared&#133; 
  I think it's a lot of good luck&#133; that I'm here today&#133; so I think that 
  this preparation for pregnancy is fundamental&#133;"</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to the care for the body, some of the women in the study gave spiritual advice 
  for other women, for them to be with God and have faith at this difficult moment 
  of facing up to the death of the newborn. They called on other women to seek 
  comfort in God in their moment of despair. One of the women in the study had 
  a message for the doctors, for them to listen to the complaints of signs and 
  symptoms that the women themselves describe, because it is the women who are 
  experiencing and feeling the problems in their day-to-day lives and therefore 
  they are the ones in a better position to detect them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At the end 
  of the interview, each of these women was asked what they were thinking of doing 
  from now on, and what their plans were. Their replies were expressed with a 
  view to the future, whether in relation to work, future pregnancy, resumption 
  of studies or a desire to get married. The point these responses had in common 
  was an emphasis on future prospects and "moving on", accompanied by a manifest 
  intention to help other people in similar situations, because they felt prepared 
  for this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"What 
  am I doing today? I'm preparing more classes, I'm taking part in more courses, 
  because the country is you. There's no point in throwing everything onto the 
  government's shoulders. I think we should be more active, the day has 24 hours, 
  we don't even use 5 hours, if you look at it&#133; time is valuable&#133; I 
  think we have to value this time more. For you to have an idea, I know this 
  so well, because I had six months of pregnancy that were a very good experience&#133; 
  really very good&#133; and as if I had guessed that the baby wouldn't stay. 
  So you always have to live&#133; never stop&#133; but responsibly."</i> (Mariana)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"That's 
  it, to get better every day&#133; Now, at this moment, what I really need is 
  to work, because I sell flowers and I couldn't even sell flowers, because when 
  I went out in the street, everyone was asking&#133; and the belly and the baby&#133; 
  well, that shocked me even more, so I stopped&#133; I was shut up inside the 
  house&#133; the neighbors came to visit me&#133; there are some that try to 
  get you up&#133; For the last month I've been a normal person&#133; I've been 
  calm without taking tranquilizers, my tranquilizer is Jesus&#133; he's the best 
  tranquilizer&#133; Now I se myself as a normal person&#133; if anyone needs 
  me, I'm here to help and move on."</i> (Marilsa)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"I'm 
  studying to see if I can get a qualification in something, sort out my life, 
  no, I'm moving on&#133; I'm first of all thinking of getting this infection 
  treated and then marrying &#91;she already had a boyfriend&#93;&#133; to get married 
  so that it won't happen that I get pregnant and nobody wants to shoulder this 
  &#91;she cries&#93;&#133;"</i> (Antonia)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"To bring 
  up the boys and&#133; I don't know&#133; get a job, work, because I'm unemployed&#133; 
  work to help my mother&#133; these things&#133; It's not that a live child makes 
  a difference from a dead one, I think&#133; you carry it in the belly for nine 
  months for it to then&#133; be born dead&#133; I think that if it had been born 
  alive, I'd be bringing it up in the same way I've brought up the others&#133; 
  But now it's happened&#133; I just pray every night and ask that it may rest 
  in peace... a little angel&#133; it didn't see anything&#133; it didn't even 
  get to breast-feed from me, nothing&#133; I won't forget it, no&#133;"</i> (Ane)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Ah, 
  I intend to get pregnant in the year 2000&#133; if God so wishes&#133; But the 
  next one will go OK&#133; if God so wishes."</i> (Alzira)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the light 
  of this, it can be seen that the women have now shifted the focus of their problems 
  from the loss of the baby, which until then had been the center of their preoccupations, 
  to a view of the future projected from the present. Thus, through their experience 
  of fetal loss, they have been able to find out many things about themselves 
  that had until then been unknown, concealed and muted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Souza<sup>17</sup> (1998), "the definition and explanation of an illness 
  &#91;problem&#93; is an interpretative act involving reflection and distancing, when 
  the subject goes back over his experiences to interpret them, when he is no 
  longer within the flow of experiences, which, seen in retrospect, appear to 
  be full of meaning". (p.151)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In attempting 
  to summarize the comprehension of the significance of losing the baby through 
  the interviewees' words, it can be recognized that: <i>"It was an experience&#133; 
  a pain&#133; a hard experience that came to shake me and made me think of disappearing 
  from the world. It signified the loss of a piece, a part of me, but my baby 
  will never be forgotten, because it was unique, special and it brought happiness. 
  It also made me reflect, with changes in my attitude to life, in the sense of 
  finding or rediscovering a mother's love and bringing maturation within my identity 
  as a woman, showing the importance of valuing life, living for now, this minute, 
  and responsibly. For me, it's only God Himself who can give an explanation, 
  but at the same time, He was the one who comforted me most and made me see that 
  we are nothing in comparison with the universe and it was only like this that 
  He made me comprehend that the loss of my baby, instead of meaning nothing, 
  meant everything."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Experience, 
  as employed here, is in the sense conferred by Benjamin, for whom "experience 
  is not what takes place and is registered outside of the subject, but rather 
  what occurs with/within the subject and therefore modifies, transforms and alters 
  his identity" (Sousa<sup>16</sup> 1998, p.262).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The lesson 
  from Benjamin<sup>3</sup> (1994) is that "the experience that is gone through 
  is passed from person to person by the anonymous narrators of oral histories 
  and, from such narrative, the experience is clarified with a practical sense 
  that can constitute a teaching, a practical suggestion or a guideline for life" 
  (p.198-200).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">But furthermore, 
  "the advice is sewn into the live substance of existence and has a name: wisdom" 
  (p.200).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  qualitative study has allowed us to obtain a closer comprehension of the significance 
  of the fetal loss experienced by some women, taking into consideration all the 
  dimensions of the human being.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was possible 
  to glean information for understanding such women's sociocultural realities 
  from the different circumstances that they reported and their relationships 
  with the healthcare services, religious institutions and other people. This 
  showed how all these relationships occurred and were felt by such women when 
  faced with their problem.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There needs 
  to be a change in general concepts in the mission to attend to such women. The 
  attendance provided by the healthcare services needs to be humanized. The need 
  for multiprofessional follow-up of healthcare service users who suffered fetal 
  loss was very evident. The importance of a support network for women who have 
  gone through this problem was also shown.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Fetal loss 
  is a rupture or crisis in the lives of these women. It implies a need for them 
  to reconstruct their identities on a new basis that will enable them to take 
  a leap forward in the quality of their lives and give them the wisdom for them 
  to counsel other women so that these others may avoid going through similar 
  processes.</font></p>
