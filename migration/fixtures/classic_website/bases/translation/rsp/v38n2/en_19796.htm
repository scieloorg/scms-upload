<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The antibacterial 
  activity of essential oils extracted from medicinal plants (<i>Ocimum gratissimum</i>, 
  L., <i>Cybopogum citratus</i> (DC) Stapf., and <i>Salvia officinalis</i>, L.) 
  was assessed on bacterial strains derived from 100 urine samples. Samples were 
  taken from subjects diagnosed with urinary tract infection living in the community. 
  Microorganisms were plated on M&uuml;ller Hinton agar. Plant extracts were applied 
  using a Steers replicator and petri dishes were incubated at 37&deg;C for 24 
  hours. Salvia officinalis, L. showed enhanced inhibitory activity compared to 
  the other two herbs, with 100% efficiency against <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Enterobacter 
  species</i>, 96% against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 83% against <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, 
  and 75% against <i>Morganella morganii</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Historical records indicate that, as long as 2,600 years ago, the Chinese already 
  developed drugs using a number of forms of phytotherapeutic agent elaboration. 
  This was also the case with the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In light of the recent emergence of bacteria which are resistant to multiple 
  antimicrobial drugs, posing a challenge for the treatment of infections, the 
  need to discover new antimicrobial substances for use in combating such microorganisms 
  becomes patent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian savannah is very diverse and rich. It includes a number of plants 
  that are used in natural medicine for treating tropical diseases, including 
  bacterial infections.<sup>1,4</sup> On the other hand, due to the lack of knowledge 
  concerning the potential toxic activity and adequate usage, medicinal herbs 
  are often used incorrectly, thereby not yielding the desired effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Species known to produce antiseptic essential oils include wild basil (<i>Ocimum 
  gratissimum</i>, L.);<sup>7</sup> lemon grass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i> (DC) 
  Stapf);<sup>8</sup> and sage (<i>Salvia officinalis</i> L.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Cymbopogom citratus</i> (DC) Stapf. essential oil is includes mircene, neral, 
  geranial, and other unidentified compounds<sup>2</sup> and is used for fighting 
  colds, dysentery, headaches, and also as a tranquilizer and antispasmodic, besides 
  its antimicrobial activity.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Ocimum gratissimum</i> L. is widespread in the tropics. It is used in popular 
  medicine for treating upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, cough, 
  fever, and conjunctivitis. The oil extracted from this plant contains the following 
  compounds: 1,8 cineol, eugenol, methyl-eugenol, thymol, p-cimene, cis-ocimene, 
  and cis-caryophyllene, and, in different concentrations inhibited the growth 
  of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i>, 
  <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella sp</i>., <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, and 
  <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The essential oil extracted from <i>S. officinalis,</i> L., used as a medicinal 
  herb, has antibacterial activity due to the presence of 1,8-cineol<sup>3</sup> 
  and of an antifungal substance.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present study was aimed at studying the antimicrobial activity of essential 
  oils extracted from <i>Ocimum gratissimum</i> L., <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i> 
  (DC) Stapf., and <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L. against enterobacteria and <i>Pseudomonas 
  aeruginosa</i> isolated from urinary tract infections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One hundred samples were collected from the middle portion of the urine of 
  patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection in the municipality of Ca&ccedil;apava, 
  southeastern Brazil. The samples collected were striated on DIFCO agar <u>p</u>etri 
  dishes and incubated at 37&ordm;C for 24h. The colonies isolated were identified 
  by biochemical testing. The three herbs were picked between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
  from the Agrarian Science Department of the Universidade de Taubat&eacute;, 
  state of S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Essential oil extraction was performed using the hydrodistillation technique 
  proposed by Craveiro et al<sup>2</sup> (1981). 100 g of leaves (herb) and 250 
  ml of water were placed in a 500 ml Kitassato. Upon heating on a Bunsen burner, 
  a stream of vapor was generated and was collected using a 75 cm serpentine. 
  The oil was then separated from the water with the aid of a 500 ml separation 
  funnel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One hundred ml of each strain were plated on M&uuml;ller Hinton agar. The oils 
  extracted were applied using a Steers replicator and <u>p</u>etri dishes were 
  incubated at 37&ordm; C for 24h. Reading was done by observing microbial growth 
  inhibition at the sites where essential oils were applied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 100 samples analyzed, 79% were of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Other enterobacteria 
  were observed at levels below 8%. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> accounted for 
  1% of samples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The antimicrobial 
  activity of the essential oil extracted from <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L. showed 
  a mean 79% de inhibition (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A comparison of the activity levels of the three herbs showed the greater efficiency 
  of <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L. The different species analyzed were over 96% 
  effective against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, 100% against <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, 
  over 83% against <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, 75% against <i>Morganella morganii</i>, 
  100% against <i>Enterobacter aerogenes,</i> and 100% against <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i>. 
  There was no antimicrobial activity on <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Although less efficient than <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L., <i>O. gratissimum</i> 
  L. and <i>C. citratus</i> (DC) Stapf. Showed antimicrobial activity on 16% of 
  the strains analyzed, with the exception of <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i> and <i>Pseudomonas 
  aeruginosa.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Escherichia coli</i> was the most frequent etiological agent of urinary 
  infection among the subjects analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The bactericidal activity of the medicinal herbs studied was satisfactory, 
  especially that of <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L. An adequate toxicological study 
  must be carried out so as to verify the possibility of using these herbs for 
  fighting microorganisms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A single 
  strain of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> was resistant to the three oils analyzed. 
  This species is of great importance in hospital infections, and it deserved 
  a wider ranging investigation, including a larger number of strains.</font></p>
