<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To analyze IMR evolution in the S&atilde;o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) 
  between 1980 and 2000, in terms of spatial, age and, causal differences.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> SPMA municipalities were divided into 5 groups, based on their 
  1980 IMRs: <font face="Symbol">&sup3;</font>90&#137; lb (Group 1); 70-89&#137; 
  lb (Group 2); 50-69&#137; lb (Group 3); &lt;50&#137; lb (Group 4). Group 5 comprised 
  the municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo itself (IMR=51&#137; lb). The analysis 
  of trends was carried out using exponential regression models.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> IMR and its components showed a statistically significant decrease 
  (p&lt;0.05), with coefficients of determination between 66 and 98%, indicating 
  goodness of fit of the exponential model to all the time series analyzed. SPMA 
  IMR fell 69.4%, from 55.2 to 16.9&#137; lb, and Groups 1-5 showed reductions 
  of 83.9%, 76.2%, 71.3%, 58.7%, and 68.8%, indicating that the groups with highest 
  IMRs also showed the greatest reductions during the studied period.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> IMRs were homogenized at around 18&#137; lb in all municipality 
  groups in the SPMA. One-half of all deaths were concentrated within the first 
  week of life, and were due primarily to conditions originating in the perinatal 
  period, indicating that greater care during the pre- and post-delivery periods 
  will be required if the IMR in the SPMA is to descend to levels compatible with 
  those of developed countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Infant 
  Mortality Rate (IMR) has been used as an indicator not only of the quality of 
  child health, but also of the level of development of a society. The IMR estimates 
  the risk of a child dying during infancy (before reaching age 1 year), and can 
  express the ability a community has to fulfill the nutritional, housing, and 
  healthcare needs of its newborn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">IMRs in 
  Brazil have decreased greatly in the last twenty years, falling from 69&#137; 
  live births in 1980 to 30&#137; live births (lb) in 2000, a 57% decrease. Despite 
  these numbers, infant mortality rates in Brazil are still high if compared to 
  those of developed countries, in which IMRs were already below 15&#137; lb in 
  the 1980's. There are differences in the rates of infant mortality between the 
  five Brazilian Regions: whereas the South and Southeast Regions have rates close 
  to 20&#137; lb, the rates in the Northeast Region are above 40&#137; lb.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Located 
  in the Southeast Region, the S&atilde;o Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA), currently 
  spanning 39 municipalities, is the largest urban center in Brazil, and one of 
  the largest in the world. From 1950 to 1970, a large contingent of immigrants, 
  especially from the Northeastern states, established themselves in the SPMA. 
  This phenomenon promoted an increase in the demand for urban infrastructure 
  and healthcare services, generating heterogeneous living standards and patent 
  social exclusion. The aim of the present study is to analyze the evolution of 
  infant mortality rates within the S&atilde;o Paulo Metropolitan Area – between 
  1980 and 2000 – with emphasis on spatial differences.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Mortality 
  rates were calculated for the early neonatal (0-6 days after delivery), late 
  neonatal (7-27 days after delivery), and post neonatal (28-364 days after delivery) 
  periods, as well as for the entire period (0-364 days after delivery) for all 
  municipalities in the SPMA, between 1980 and 2000. The number of deaths according 
  to age group was taken from data provided by the Ministry of Health's <i>Sistema 
  de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Mortalidade</i> (Mortality Information System 
  – SIM/MS). The number of live births was taken from the <i>Sistema Estadual 
  de An&aacute;lise de Dados</i> (State Data Analysis System – SEADE) Foundation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Specific 
  mortality rates were calculated for the 5 major causes of death in the 1980-2000 
  period, based on International Classification of Diseases – 9<sup>th</sup> review 
  (ICD-9) chapters I (Infectious and Parasitic Diseases), III (Endocrine, nutritional, 
  and metabolic diseases and immune disorders), VIII (Diseases of the respiratory 
  system), XIV (Congenital malformations), and XV (Certain conditions originating 
  in the perinatal period).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">SPMA municipalities 
  were divided into 5 groups (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), based on their 1980 
  IMRs: =90&#137; lb (Group 1); 70-89&#137; lb (Group 2); 50-69&#137; lb (Group 
  3); &lt;50&#137; lb (Group 4). Group 5 comprised the municipality of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo itself (IMR=51&#137; lb).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The socioeconomic 
  variables analyzed in each group included: percentage of households connected 
  to the water supply and sewage networks, percentage literacy above age 5 years, 
  and percentage households according to head of family's mean monthly income 
  class (in number of minimum wages), collected in the 1980 and 2000 censuses.<sup>3,4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Trends in 
  IMR and its components, according to municipality group and cause of death, 
  were analyzed using exponential regression models<sup>5</sup> <img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n2/19776_enx1.gif" align="absmiddle"> 
  in which dependent variable (Y) is the infant mortality rate (dependent variable), 
  X is the corresponding year (independent variable), and <font face="Symbol">b</font><sub>1</sub> 
  is the mean of the yearly increment during the studied period. In order to avoid 
  auto-correlation between the points,<sup>6</sup> the independent variable was 
  centralized (X-1990 and X-1988). X-1990 corresponds to the middle point of the 
  time series for IMR and its components by age from 1980 to 2000, and X-1988 
  to the middle point of the time series for cause-specific rates, from 1980 to 
  1995. A trend was considered as significant when p&lt;0.05. The determination 
  coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) was used to evaluate the model's explanatory power 
  (the closer this value is to 1, the better the model).<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Infant mortality 
  and its components decreased in all municipality groups (<a href="#fig">Figure 
  1</a>). The SPMA showed a 69.4% decrease in IMR between 1980 and 2000 (55.2 
  to 16.9&#137; lb). Percent decreases in IMR in the five municipality groups 
  were 83.9%, 76.2%, 71.3%, 58.7%, and 68.8%, respectively (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). Therefore, the groups with highest IMRs were also those that registered 
  the greatest decrease, which brought all IMRs in 2000 to somewhere around 18&#137; 
  lb.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Groups 1 
  and 2, which in 1980 had the highest IMRs, had also the worst socioeconomic 
  conditions, with lower percentage of households connected to the water supply 
  and sewage networks, lower literacy, and greater number of low-income households 
  (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The great increase in the SPMA water supply network 
  accounted for the 90% coverage registered in all groups at the end of the period. 
  Likewise, illiteracy rates in all groups had also fallen below 10% by 2000. 
  Sewage system coverage, however, is still not universal. Furthermore, the proportion 
  of families included in the lowest income categories increased in all groups.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">IMR and 
  its components showed a statistically significant decrease (p&lt;0.05), with 
  determination coefficients between 66 and 98%, indicating the goodness of fit 
  of the exponential model to all the time series analyzed (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>). Among the components of infant mortality, the post-neonatal period showed 
  the greatest rate of decrease in all groups, followed by the late neonatal period. 
  The early neonatal period had the lowest rate of decrease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In all analyses, 
  the lowest rates of decrease were registered in Group 4, which consists of the 
  municipalities with IMRs below 50&#137; lb in 1980.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Infectious 
  and parasitic diseases showed the highest rate of decrease in all municipality 
  groups and in SPMA as a whole (<a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). Congenital malformations 
  showed the lowest rate of decrease as well as the lowest determination coefficients. 
  In Group 4, IMRs due to endocrinal and nutritional diseases and congenital malformations 
  remained stable throughout the period. This was also the case with congenital 
  malformations in Group 5.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The infant 
  mortality rate is one of the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> 
  (Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics – IBGE) Foundation's Minimal 
  Social Indicators, which are part of the minimal national databases recommended 
  by several international conferences promoted by the United Nations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The state 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo has one of the lowest rates of under-reporting in the country 
  (2% for the number of live births and 10% for the number of deaths).<sup>12</sup> 
  This allows for direct calculation of infant mortality rates, and for reliable 
  time series to be built for the last two decades.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 
  the marked decrease observed in the period , the IMR in the S&atilde;o Paulo 
  Metropolitan Area is still high when compared to developed countries, such as 
  France (6&#137; lb), Portugal (9&#137; lb), Japan (4&#137; lb), and United States 
  (7&#137; lb); even though, all municipality groups showed values below 30&#137; 
  lb (Brazil, 2000) and the 34&#137; lb mean rate of all WHO member countries<sup>15</sup> 
  (1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 1980, 
  at least 50% of deaths occurred within the post-neonatal period. With the decrease 
  observed in this component, there is a relative shift in the proportion deaths 
  towards the neonatal period, especially to the early neonatal period, corresponding 
  to the first 7 days of life. Likewise, there was a marked decrease in the proportion 
  of deaths due to infections and parasitic diseases; endocrinal, metabolic, and 
  nutritional diseases; and diseases of the respiratory system, which in together 
  accounted for almost 70% of all infant deaths in 1980.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, 
  with the reductions in the number of deaths due to these diseases, the proportion 
  of deaths caused by conditions originating in the perinatal period rose to 60% 
  of all infant deaths, across all groups. Szwarcwald et al<sup>13</sup> compared 
  the reductions in early neonatal and post neonatal mortality rates registered 
  several Brazilian states, including S&atilde;o Paulo, to results obtained in 
  Japan, Chile, United States, and certain European countries, concluding that 
  the reductions achieved in these states were compatible with those of other 
  countries only in terms of the post-neonatal component. The authors add that 
  the countries listed only achieved such low levels of infant mortality (below 
  10&#137; lb) after reducing the early neonatal component. As in developed countries, 
  an important reduction in infant mortality in the SPMA will only occur when 
  a reduction in the early neonatal component is achieved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In all SPMA 
  municipality groups, the greatest reduction in mortality levels was observed 
  in the post-neonatal component. In Guarulhos, the greatest trend towards reduction 
  in the 1971-1998 period was registered in the post-neonatal component.<sup>14</sup> 
  The implementation of a healthcare network and the improvements in supply which 
  took place in that municipality from the 1970's on were pointed out as potential 
  causes for this decrease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In Botucatu 
  (S&atilde;o Paulo state), inadequate water supply and low maternal schooling 
  were associated to an increased risk of infant mortality.<sup>8</sup> In the 
  present study, infants living in municipalities included in Groups 1 and 2 – 
  which at the beginning of the period presented the worst sanitary conditions 
  and the highest illiteracy rates – were also at the highest risk of dying. At 
  the end of the period, with the improvements observed in these indicators, IMR 
  levels were similar across the 5 groups.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An analysis 
  of the trends observed in cause-specific mortality rates in the SPMA showed 
  a greater reduction in the number of deaths due to infectious diseases in all 
  groups, probably due to the increase in water supply and sewage network coverage. 
  Monteiro and Naz&aacute;rio<sup>11</sup> (1995), in a study of infant mortality 
  in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo between 1973 and 1993 (which divided the city 
  into 3 income-based regions) also concluded that differences in mortality distribution 
  were less marked at the end of the period, especially due to increases in water 
  supply in poor regions and the consequent decreases in the number of deaths 
  by infectious diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In Rio de 
  Janeiro state, mortality rates decreased unequally between 1979 and 1993.<sup>7</sup> 
  The reductions reached in the regions with highest IMRs were related to the 
  post-neonatal component, which, according to the authors, was greatly influenced 
  by the amplification of the public water supply network and of healthcare service 
  coverage. Likewise, the decrease in IMR in the SPMA was more marked in regions 
  where sanitation conditions were most deficient, due to the increase in the 
  number of water supply connections registered during the study period. This 
  happened in spite of the reduction in purchasing power observed in the SPMA 
  population. Other improvements in infant health indicators, such as increases 
  in the duration of breastfeeding and in the percentage of children receiving 
  immunization and improvements in antenatal care, are likely to have contributed 
  towards the advancement of infant health as a whole.<sup>2,10</sup> Reductions 
  in fecundity – and consequent reductions in the number of births – may also 
  have contributed towards the decrease in IMR.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Generally 
  speaking, the analysis of IMRs in the S&atilde;o Paulo Metropolitan Area showed 
  that public policies aimed at improving basic sanitary conditions have been 
  effective in reducing post-neonatal mortality, which is due mainly to diseases 
  related to the environment in which the child lives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Almeida 
  et al<sup>1</sup> (2002), in an analysis of neonatal mortality in the city of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo, highlighted the association between socioeconomic conditions 
  and the type of service used by pregnant mothers. These factors – combined with 
  the relative increase in the proportion of deaths occurred in the early neonatal 
  period and with the reduction of population-wide income levels, registered in 
  the present study – indicate the need for a healthcare policy that prioritizes 
  the improvement of services and personnel related to newborn and maternal care 
  in the pre- and post-delivery periods, thus ensuring a more systematical surveillance 
  of high-risk newborns. Access to these services, regardless of socioeconomic 
  level, is likely to reduce the IMRs of all SPMA municipalities to levels compatible 
  with those of developed countries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  IMRs were homogenized at around 18&#137; lb in all municipality groups in the 
  SPMA. One-half of all deaths were concentrated within the first week of life, 
  and were due primarily to conditions originating in the perinatal period. This 
  indicates the need for improvements in care during the pre- and post-delivery 
  periods in order to promote further reductions in IMR.</font></p>
