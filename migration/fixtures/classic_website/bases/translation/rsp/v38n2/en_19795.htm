<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This study 
  determined the species of parasitoids associated with <i>Chrysomya megacephala</i>, 
  collected on bovine kidney baits, in Itumbiara, State of Goias, Brazil. The 
  pupae were obtained by flotation. They were individually placed in gelatin capsules 
  until the emergence of the adult flies or their parasitoids. The overall prevalence 
  of parasitism was 18.6%. <i>Brachymeria podagrica</i>, <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> 
  and <i>Pachycrepoideus vindemiae</i> presented frequencies of 8.6%, 8.6% and 
  1.4%, respectively. This work reports for the first time the occurrence of <i>Brachymeria 
  podagrica</i> in pupae of <i>Chrysomya megacephala</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Pieces of bovine kidney served as the bait for the flies and were placed inside 
  the cans, on a layer of earth. Five traps were utilized, and these were hung 
  from eucalyptus trees (<i>Eucalyptus</i> sp.) at a height of 1 meter off the 
  ground and a separation of 2 meters from each other, at a distance of 50 meters 
  from domestic garbage. The adult individuals collected were taken to the laboratory, 
  sacrificed using ethyl ether and preserved in 70% alcohol for later identification.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To obtain the parasitoids, the contents of the traps were placed in plastic 
  receptacles containing a sand layer that served as a substrate for the pupation 
  of the larvae. Fifteen days after placing in the field, the sand was sieved 
  to extract the pupae. These pupae were then placed individually in gelatin capsules 
  (number =00), to obtain the adult flies and/or parasitoids. The percentage prevalence 
  of parasitism was calculated as the number of pupae containing parasites divided 
  by the total number of pupae collected, multiplied by 100.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">During the 
  period from March to October 2002, 122 parasite specimens were collected from 
  70 pupae of <i>Chrysomya megacephala</i> (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The 
  total prevalence of parasitism was 18.6%. This high prevalence of parasitism 
  was probably due to the presence of gregarious parasitoids. The parasitoids 
  collected belonged to three species: <i>Brachymeria podagrica</i> (Fabricius) 
  (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> (Walker) (Hymenoptera: 
  Pteromalidae) and <i>Pachycrepoideus vindemiae</i> (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), 
  accounting for 8.6%, 8.6% and 1.4%, respectively, within the total prevalence 
  (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The specimens of <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i> and <i>Pachycrepoideus</i> <i>vindemiae</i> 
  were identified in accordance with Legner et al<sup>5</sup> (1976) and <i>Brachymeria 
  podagrica</i> in accordance with Burks<sup>2</sup> (1960). The reference material 
  was stored in the Biology Department of Instituto Luterano de Ensino Superior, 
  Itumbiara, GO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The parasitoid that was collected the most was <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i>, 
  because in addition to behaving as a gregarious parasitoid, it was also the 
  species that attacked the greatest number of pupae of <i>C. megacephala</i>. 
  This was probably due to variations in the quality and availability of resources 
  and the host-seeking capacity of this parasitoid or the host density. This species 
  attacks several species of Diptera, particularly those in the families Calliphoridae, 
  Muscidae, Sarcophagidae and Tachinidae.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Brachymeria podagrica</i> (Fabricius) occurs practically worldwide, in association 
  with synanthropic and other Diptera.<sup>2</sup> <i>Pachycrepoideus vindemiae</i> 
  is considered to be a solitary parasitoid of numerous Diptera in the families 
  Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae and Tephritidae, 
  among others. The geographical distribution of this species extends beyond South 
  America to North America and Africa.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since the control of flies by means of insecticides may lead to the selection 
  of resistant populations, there is a need for new control methodologies.</font></p>
