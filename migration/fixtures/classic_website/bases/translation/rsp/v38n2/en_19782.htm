<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To evaluate the knowledge of the generic designation, use and composition 
  of analgesic medications containing aspirin.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A total of124 interviews were carried out between December 1999 
  and January 2000, in two neighborhoods of the city of Porto Alegre, southern 
  Brazil. The interview was held with the person who came to answer the door at 
  each of the homes that was drawn. The data collection instruments comprised 
  a set of five different pharmaceutical specialties containing acetylsalicylic 
  acid , and an interview consisting of two open questions concerning the differences 
  and similarities between the products.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Three major knowledge-level groups were characterized on the 
  basis of the information that the interviewees were able to provide. The group 
  that was knowledgeable about the matter comprised 14 individuals (11%). The 
  group with limited knowledge contained 61 people (49)%. Those who had no knowledge 
  of the matter at all formed a group of 49 people (40%).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Taking the results as a whole, they indicate that most people 
  (about 90% of the sample investigated) are simply not aware of what the active 
  substance is, even in pharmaceutical specialties that they use frequently.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Medications 
  play a central role in the healthcare practices of modern society, such that 
  the majority of therapeutic interventions involve the utilization of at least 
  one medication. Consequently, it can be stated that medications are present 
  in all homes, considering that treatment is generally not exclusively performed 
  within the domains of hospitals, outpatient services and medical consultation 
  offices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among medications, 
  analgesics certainly form one of the most widely used groups, because they are 
  utilized in pain relief and are easy to obtain. Some analgesics are freely sold 
  over the counter. They are prominently available outside of pharmaceutical establishments, 
  such as in bars, warehouses and grocery stores,<sup>8</sup> thereby going against 
  the legal regulations. People are also systematically induced to use them, through 
  advertising in the mass communication media, especially radio and television.<sup>5</sup> 
  In this context, it is unsurprising that Brazilian studies on self-medication, 
  performed in the cities of Fortaleza (Ceara),<sup>1</sup> Belo Horizonte (Minas 
  Gerais)<sup>4</sup> and Santa Maria (Rio Grande do Sul),<sup>9</sup> have indicated 
  the predominance of analgesics among the most utilized drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, 
  medications are the main agents capable of causing poisoning in human beings. 
  Data from the National System for Toxicopharmacological Information (<i>Sistema 
  Nacional de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Toxico-Farmacol&oacute;gicas</i> - SINITOX) 
  show that 28.5% of the cases of poisoning registered are due to drug utilization.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to the impact of medications in terms of poisoning, it needs to be stressed 
  that there is a lack of data on other events resulting from inappropriate use 
  of medications, such as occurrences of adverse reactions and questionable treatment 
  effectiveness that are possibly caused by a lack of knowledge among patients 
  regarding their medications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Informing 
  the public is one of the ways of minimizing the risks relating to poisoning 
  and the occurrence of adverse reactions. The present work was developed with 
  the objective of assessing what knowledge people have of the composition of 
  analgesic medications containing acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This drug was 
  chosen as the study instrument because of its high prevalence on the market 
  and widespread utilization, even in situations in which it is not considered 
  to be the recommended analgesic.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews 
  were held with 124 people living in a district of Porto Alegre, State of Rio 
  Grande do Sul, between December 1999 and January 2000. Two units of the coverage 
  zone of the community healthcare service were located in this district. The 
  interview was held with the person who came to answer the door at each of the 
  homes drawn. One person refused to answer the questionnaire, corresponding to 
  0.8% of the sample.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In pretesting 
  performed during the development of the data collection instrument, attempts 
  were made to ascertain what knowledge people have of the four analgesics that 
  are sold in Brazil without needing a prescription: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), 
  dipyrone (metamizole), paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen. The results 
  obtained from this set of medications furnished a picture that was difficult 
  to interpret. For this reason, the final investigation was performed on only 
  one analgesic, namely acetylsalicylic acid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  collection instruments consisted of a set of five packs of pharmaceutical specialties 
  containing acetylsalicylic acid (three containing 500 mg, one of 650 mg and 
  one of 500 mg that was a buffered tablet) and an interview of two questions: 
  "What are the similarities between these medications?" and "What are the differences 
  between these medications?". During the interview, the interviewee was given 
  the possibility of handling the packs containing the medications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">After analyzing 
  the interviews, three major knowledge-level groups were characterized on the 
  basis of the information that the interviewee was able to provide in response 
  to the questions. The groups were subdivided according to the specific details 
  of the information.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The responses 
  from the 124 interviews were grouped to form the knowledge-level groups. The 
  information given in each interview was used to create a profile that related 
  such knowledge to the benefits it brings to the population, such as the protection 
  offered by knowledge of the active substance and people's capacity to choose 
  generic drugs, among other factors. The set of responses led to the establishment 
  of three major groups:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Group 1: Demonstration of full knowledge of the subject;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Group 2: Demonstration of limited knowledge of the subject;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; 
    Group 3: No demonstration of any knowledge of the subject.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Group 
  1</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
  group was characterized by clear knowledge of the active substance in the medication. 
  Fourteen people showed this, corresponding to 11% of the sample (<a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>). People were said to be knowledgeable if they were able to identify the 
  active substance, the therapeutic class and the uses of all the specialties 
  presented. For these people, it was clear that these were different products 
  containing the same active agent. It must be noted that, since the time of this 
  survey, there has been a change in the legislation, in which it was determined 
  that medications of composition similar to a reference medication registered 
  with the federal authorities can only be identified and commercialized by the 
  brand or commercial name ("similar" drugs according to Brazilian legislation). 
  Only medications approved according to law no. 9787 of 1999 can now be designated 
  via generic names ("generic" drugs according to Brazilian legislation).<sup>3</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Group 
  2</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The second 
  group was formed by 61 people (49% of the interviewees), and this group was 
  characterized by having some knowledge of the active substance and/or the class 
  of the medications. These people were able to identify the active substance 
  and/or the therapeutic class and/or the uses of some of the products presented. 
  They did not have a clear notion that these consisted of the same active agent 
  in different products. Within this group, 56% knew that these products were 
  analgesics, or "for pain", or could relate the brand to the active substance, 
  even if unable to identify that all the products presented the same component. 
  The other 44% could relate the brand to the use, or found a relationship between 
  the brands (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="tab2"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n2/19782_ent2.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  subgroups consisted of people who were able to relate the therapeutic use of 
  the medication to the pharmaceutical specialty. For example, one product was 
  cited mostly in relation to headache, another in cases of fever and a third 
  as an anti-inflammatory drug. These individuals had very limited knowledge, 
  because despite being able to indicate a given specialty, they attributed differences 
  in specialty that do not exist in relation to therapeutic use (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Group 
  3</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The third 
  group included the people who only cited the brand, said they were all the same 
  or all different without giving reasons, cited a non-therapeutic similarity 
  or difference, or simply said they did not know. This group was formed by 49 
  people, corresponding to 40% of the total sample (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="tab3"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n2/19782_ent3.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Taking the 
  results as a whole, it can be seen that the majority of the people in the sample 
  (around 90%) simply do not know what active substance is present in pharmaceutical 
  specialties that they frequently use. Consequently, people often do not make 
  use of a given product because they know they are unable to ingest that active 
  agent, but they end up using it with a different brand name. Some of the declarations 
  illustrate this: "... There was no way I'd take product E, because it attacked 
  the heart, and so I was taking product A, and now the doctor has prohibited&#133;", 
  "... I don't take product E, I don't know what it's got in it that's not good 
  for me...". Similarly, they often attribute collateral effect to the specialty, 
  rather than to the active substance. The effects most frequently cited were 
  acceleration of the heart rate and stomach irritation, for example: "... Product 
  E gets my heart going faster...", "... If you take medication A without sugar, 
  it gives you stomach ache...", "... It's not good for you...", "... Because 
  of its size, product D hurts the stomach...", "... Product D gets my heart going 
  faster...".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 
  the results presented, some people used ways of differentiating between the 
  pharmaceutical specialties that did not fit in with the expected response. They 
  pointed out characteristics of the specialties that did not help from the point 
  of view of safety and rational usage, but which in many cases denoted that the 
  name of the specialty is a reference and has its own identity, independent of 
  the active substance: "... Product D has been around a long time; I used it 
  when I was a child...", "... I used to use product D, and then I started using 
  product E, and now I only use product A...", "... Medication A is better in 
  all senses...", "... I prefer product A because it is more complete than the 
  others...", "... I only take product A...", "... Product B does not leave a 
  taste in the mouth like A does...". These declarations, from the frequency with 
  which they were observed, suggest that the brand name is a much more striking 
  and deep-rooted form of identity than the generic designation, in the culture 
  of the use of medications.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The drawing 
  up of the knowledge-level categories was done in accordance with the responses 
  to the open questions. The profiles of the groups were outlined from the level 
  of information demonstrated in relation to the active component of the analgesic 
  medications. The investigation did not seek to gauge whether the individuals 
  who demonstrated a greater level of knowledge really utilized the medications 
  more correctly. Nor did it allow inferences to be drawn regarding the existence 
  of other mechanisms that could protect the individuals who demonstrated limited 
  knowledge. The work sought to evaluate how people recognize and understand the 
  names of medications. For this, the group of medications with the most widespread 
  utilization was selected: this was presumed to be the best-known group. The 
  categories were drawn up after the interviews and presented a high degree of 
  subjectivity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">People who 
  are knowledgeable about medications are in an advantageous position. This results 
  from the clear understanding that they demonstrate regarding the active substance, 
  class and use of medications. With such information, these people are more protected 
  in the event of some risk that is associated with the active agent. Moreover, 
  it can be supposed that they may be able to choose different brands of medication 
  containing the same active agent, thereby enabling price analysis. They are 
  therefore capable of making choices between generic drugs and similar drugs 
  ("<i>similar</i>" drugs according to Brazilian legislation are products with 
  pharmaceutical equivalence but without proven bioequivalence).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">People who 
  demonstrate limited knowledge about medications may have some significant difficulties 
  in utilizing them. Their analysis of the prices of different brands and the 
  use of generic and similar drugs, and their protection in relation to the risk 
  associated with the active agent are diminished. Those that can relate the brand 
  to the active substance have protection in relation to the risk resulting from 
  lack of knowledge of the generic designation. However, this is a relative protection, 
  or in other words, it is only useful when the same specialty is used. For example, 
  for people for whom acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated and who said that 
  "... products A and B have acetylsalicylic acid...", they will only be protected 
  when they utilize the same pharmaceutical specialties that do not contain this 
  component. If these are substituted by the specialties C and D, in which these 
  people do not perceive the presence of the active agent, they will be exposed 
  to the effects of the active agents that ought to be avoided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Individuals 
  who do not have knowledge of medications do not have the knowledge needed for 
  making rational use of them. They are less protected in the event of the active 
  agent being contraindicated in a specific situation. Without the minimum of 
  information, analysis of the prices and use of generic and similar medications 
  becomes very difficult.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The lack 
  of knowledge of the essential characteristics for the utilization of these products 
  with a minimum of safety, among the majority of the population, which was seen 
  specifically in relation to the group of medications with which they have greatest 
  contact, indicates a need for action by healthcare professionals regarding the 
  characterization of the public's knowledge. Information regarding medications, 
  both for those sold over the counter and on prescription, must demystify possibly 
  erroneous concepts among the public and contribute towards economical and rational 
  utilization. In relation to medications sold over the counter, it also needs 
  to highlighted that many products have poor therapeutic quality<sup>6</sup> 
  and that advertising has an inductive power<sup>5</sup> that seeks to associate 
  particular and exclusive positive characteristics to each brand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Healthcare 
  professionals must recognize the difference between passing on information and 
  educating the patient, because it is difficult to evaluate how such information 
  is comprehended. Patients must be strongly stimulated to make comments and have 
  their doubts clarified, thus enabling the acquisition of the knowledge needed 
  for using medications safely and rationally.</font></p>
