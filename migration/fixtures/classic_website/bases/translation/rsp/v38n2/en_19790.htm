<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To determine the prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption and factors associated 
  with it in a Brazilian adult population.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Cross-sectional population-based study including 2,177 adults 
  (aged 20 to 69), living in the urban area of the municipality of Pelotas, Rio 
  Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The sample was selected in multiple stages. Heavy 
  alcohol consumption was defined as above 30g/day. The adjusted analysis was 
  conducted by logistic regression.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption was 14.3% (29.2% 
  among men and 3.7% among women). The following groups presented higher prevalences 
  of heavy alcohol consumption after adjusted analysis: men, elderly people, blacks 
  or mulattoes, heavy smokers, and people who present some kind of chronic disease. 
  Men with minor psychiatric disorders showed higher prevalences of heavy alcohol 
  consumption than other men. Among women, association between age and heavy alcohol 
  consumption was inversely related. Furthermore, the study indicates that among 
  hypertensive subjects, those with heavy alcohol consumption presented worse 
  disease management.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Heavy alcohol consumption is high and results in countless 
  negative consequences for the individual's health and quality of life. Our results 
  highlight the high prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption and indicate subsections 
  of the whole population more susceptible to alcoholism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Moderate 
  consumrtion of alcoholic beverages, according to the literature, is a protective 
  factor for mortality due to all causes, particularly due to its effect in reducing 
  the frequency of cardiovascular diseases.<sup>4,9</sup> However, heavy alcohol 
  consumption results in innumerous negative consequences for the individual's 
  health and quality of life, increasing the rate of morbidities that result in 
  death or functional limitations such as cirrhosis, some types of cancer, cerebral 
  vascular accidents, violence, mental diseases, among others.<sup>10,14,16</sup> 
  The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that mortality and functional 
  limitations resulting from heavy alcohol consumption are even greater than those 
  caused by cigarette smoking.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Alcoholism 
  is, of itself, also considered an illness and a multicentric Brazilian study<sup>1</sup> 
  indicates prevalences ranging from 7.6% to 9.2%. Another study undertaken in 
  Brazil<sup>5</sup> found a prevalence of alcoholism of 12.4% among hospital 
  patients. A study undertaken in South Korea<sup>7</sup> indicates a prevalence 
  of heavy alcohol consumption of 16% among men and 2% among women, whereas a 
  study undertaken in New Zealand<sup>6</sup> indicated a prevalence of 9.9% among 
  elderly subjects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Heavy alcohol 
  consumption also entails in higher costs for the Health Care System, both directly 
  and indirectly, because the morbidities which ensue from consumption are expensive 
  and difficult to manage. Furthermore, alcoholism also provokes family disturbances 
  with greater frequency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of this study was to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with 
  heavy alcohol consumption in an adult population in southern Brazil. Detecting 
  the population groups more exposed to heavy alcohol consumption makes it possible 
  to plan more efficacious health policies designed to decrease this morbidity 
  and other diseases unleashed by alcoholism.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional, 
  population-based study was undertaken during the period between the 3rd of December, 
  1999 and the 3rd of April, 2000, involving several aspects related to the health 
  of the adult population, aged 20 to 69, living in the urban area of Pelotas, 
  Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample 
  was selected in multiple stages. The primary sample units were the 281 census 
  tracts of the urban area of the municipality, 40 of which were selected according 
  to a systematic random sampling technique. Within the selected tracts, systematic 
  sampling of households was undertaken. All inhabitants of selected households 
  within the age range of interest to this study were interviewed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Calculation 
  of the sample size estimated a 15% prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption, 
  with a 95% confidence level, 80% testing power, exposures between 5 and 50%, 
  2.0 relative risk, as well as a 10% excess in the sample size to account for 
  eventual losses and refusals and 15% for adjusted analysis. The estimated sample 
  size resulting from the above mentioned calculations was composed of 1,595 individuals. 
  Since this study was conducted in conjunction with others, the sample was increased 
  in order to be able to account for other less common outcomes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol 
  consumption was measured by means of a questionnaire that evaluated the types, 
  quantities and frequency of individual consumption of alcoholic beverages. The 
  cut-off point for defining hazardous drinking was 30g/day or more of ethanol.<sup>9,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The independent 
  variables collected were: sex, age, skin color, (white or black/mulatto according 
  to the interviewer's observation), formal education (measured in years of schooling 
  in which the student passed on to the next grade) social level (as it is classified 
  by the <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional de Empresas de Pesquisa</i> – ANEP<sup>2</sup> 
  &#91;National Association of Research Enterprises&#93;, conjugal status (single, living 
  with a companion, widowed/separated), minor psychiatric disorders (Self Reported 
  Questionnaire - SRQ-20, with a cut-off point of 6 for men and 7 for women),<sup>8</sup> 
  hypertension (the mean of two measurements equal to or greater than 160/95 or 
  the consumption of anti-hypertensive medication), body mass index (normal: &lt;25 
  kg/m<sup>2</sup>; overweight: 25 a 29,9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; obesity: 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 
  or more),<sup>12</sup> physical activity (insufficiently active: less than 1000kcal/week 
  spent in leisure activities<sup>13</sup>), smoking (never smoked cigarettes; 
  ex-cigarette smoker; light to moderate smoker – &lt;20 cigarettes per day; heavy 
  smoker – 20 cigarettes or more per day) and chronic disease (presence of at 
  least one of the following diseases: self-referred diabetes, arterial hypertension, 
  minor psychiatric disorders, chronic bronchitis or obesity).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The consequences 
  of heavy consumption of alcohol on health care were indicated by analyzing adherence 
  to treatment for systemic arterial hypertension (measured by the adequate control 
  of blood pressure), rates of hospitalization and frequency with which the individual 
  recurred to the health services (measured by the number of visits made to the 
  services in the last year).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The interviewers 
  were medical students from the <i>Universidade Federal de Pelotas</i> &#91;The Federal 
  University of Pelotas&#93; and were submitted to a training program, including exercises 
  on standardizing the procedures for measuring weight and height as well as participation 
  in a pilot study, and were unaware of the objectives and hypothesis of the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Individuals 
  who refused to answer the questionnaire or who weren't home at the time of the 
  interview were visited two more times and at different periods of the day. Quality 
  control was carried out by applying a simplified version of the questionnaire 
  to 10% of the subjects included in the sample.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data was 
  codified and registered twice in a database using the Epi Info 6 Program and 
  automatic verification of consistency as well as amplitude was undertaken. Stata 
  7.0 and SPSS 8.0 programs were used for analyses, which consisted of a description 
  of the sample, crude analysis (of the entire sample and stratified by sex) and 
  adjusted analysis. Adjusted analysis was undergone through non-conditional logistic 
  regression, based on a conceptual model consisting of three hierarchical levels;<sup>15</sup> 
  in which the first level was composed of demographic variables (sex, age and 
  skin color), the second level contained the socio-economic variables (social 
  status – ANEP, formal education and civil status) and the third level consisted 
  of variables related to morbidity and lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, 
  minor psychiatric problems, BMI, systemic arterial hypertension and the presence 
  of chronic diseases). The variables were maintained within the model when they 
  attained a 20% level of significance and, if it reached 5%, the association 
  was considered significant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This project 
  was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the <i>Faculdade de Medicina</i> 
  of the <i>Universidade Federal de Pelotas</i> &#91;School of Medicine of the Federal 
  University of Pelotas&#93; and was considered to be of minimum risk. Consequentially, 
  only verbal consent was requested of people submitted to interviews.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One thousand 
  nine hundred and sixty eight individuals of the 2,177 considered eligible for 
  the study were interviewed, bringing the rate of losses and refusals to a total 
  of 9.6%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty one 
  percent of the study sample stated they never drank an alcoholic beverage; moderate 
  consumption (up to 30 g/day of ethanol) was reported by 65.1% of the sample 
  and the prevalence of heavy alcohol was 14.3% (95% CI 9.7%, 17.8%) being that 
  these represented 3.7% of the women and 29.2% of the men.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample 
  obtained was composed of 1,122 (57%) women, the mean age was 41.6 years, being 
  that almost half of the individuals were less than 40 years old. The majority 
  of the individuals (83%) were defined as being white. As to socioeconomic status, 
  the A and E classes of the ANEP each contained approximately 5% of the individuals 
  in the sample and the great majority of the individuals (37%) were concentrated 
  in group C. A similar distribution was found with respect to years of schooling. 
  The majority of the sample was composed of individuals who were married or lived 
  in stable relationships (61%). Data related to co-morbidity and lifestyles are 
  better described in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  of crude analysis for the occurrence of the outcome and of the several factors 
  studied are also presented in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. Significant statistical 
  association was detected between heavy alcohol consumption and male sex, non-white 
  skin color, physical activity and the presence of chronic disease, being that 
  the greatest risks for alcohol abuse were found among the male sex (OR=9.53) 
  and non-white skin color (OR=1.76). The variables formal education or schooling, 
  socio-economic level and smoking presented a linear tendency to increase in 
  prevalence according to the decrease in schooling and socioeconomic level and 
  according to the increase in cigarette consumption. <a href="#tab2">Tables 2</a> 
  and <a href="#tab3">3</a> present the crude analysis stratified by sex, in which 
  important differences may be noticed. As to the age groups, there was a tendency 
  to increase according to the increase in age, however, this is a low intensity 
  association. Among the women, sex stratification resulted in an inverse tendency. 
  The younger age group among the women presented an increased association with 
  abusive alcohol consumption. Among the men, the tendency remained the same as 
  was observed when the sample was analyzed as a whole; however the magnitude 
  of the effect was more readily demonstrated.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">No association 
  was found between heavy alcohol consumption and minor psychiatric disorders 
  or hypertension when the entire sample was analyzed, however, when subjects 
  of the male sex were analyzed separately, the presence of psychiatric disorders 
  was directly associated with the outcome.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Some of 
  the variables (socio-economic level and schooling) which presented statistical 
  significance in the sample when analyzed as a whole, when stratified according 
  to sex, particularly the female sex, lost their significance. The reverse holds 
  true for civil status, wherein single women presented a higher risk of being 
  heavy alcohol consumers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Multivariate 
  analysis yielded significant associations for the following variables: male 
  sex, old age, skin color, low socio-economic level, the presence of a chronic 
  disease and cigarette smoking (see <a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). The above variables, 
  with the exception of cigarette smoking and the presence of a chronic disease, 
  had increased effects in this analysis when compared to the crude analysis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">An analysis 
  of the relation between heavy alcohol consumption and the control of systemic 
  arterial hypertension was undertaken and an important association between heavy 
  alcohol consumption and poor control of hypertension was found both within the 
  global analysis (OR=1.73, value p&lt;0.001) and analysis stratified by sex. 
  A lower number of medical consultations were also associated to the outcome. 
  Hospitalization was also studied as a variable, but no significant associations 
  were found.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A study 
  with a cross-sectional design, despite its advantages in terms of rapid results 
  and low costs, presents some limitations as to inferences with respect to causal 
  effects, due to the fact that both exposures and outcomes are collected simultaneously. 
  Particularly with respect to this study, the relations between heavy alcohol 
  consumption and physical activity, body mass index, minor psychiatric disorders 
  and cigarette smoking may have been affected by this bias.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
  the subject's account of alcohol consumption may have been affected by memory 
  bias. However, if this bias occurred, it was probably conservative, that is, 
  the frequency of heavy alcohol consumption may be higher than declared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol 
  consumption was evaluated, as in other analyses,<sup>6,7,9</sup> by means of 
  an account of the weekly consumption of alcoholic beverages according to frequency, 
  quantity and types of beverages. However, it is known that quantification of 
  alcoholism is a controversial issue, and that the strategy utilized may sub 
  estimate the prevalence of alcohol abuse.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Considering 
  the methodological strategies undertaken in this investigation it is noteworthy 
  that there was a low percentage of losses and refusals (less than 10%) and that 
  there is a great similarity between the study sample and census data for the 
  municipality (<i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica,</i> <i>Censo 
  Demogr&aacute;fico, 2000</i> &#91;Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 
  Demographic Census, 2000&#93;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of heavy alcohol consumption (14.3%) was greater than indicated in other studies 
  that utilized the same definition of the outcome, in which prevalences ranged 
  from 7 to 10%.<sup>1,6</sup> On the other hand, studies<sup>7,14</sup> which 
  utilized the DSM III or DSM IV criteria found higher prevalences (15 to 30%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The greater 
  frequency of heavy alcohol consumption among men is consistent with the literature.<sup>6</sup> 
  A Chinese study<sup>6</sup> indicated 16% prevalence of alcoholism among men 
  and 2% among women, while, in the present study, prevalences were, respectively, 
  27.2% and 3.8%. Another study among Brazilian hospital patients<sup>5</sup> 
  detected a 22% prevalence among men, whereas the prevalence among women was 
  only 3%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As to age, 
  differences were also observed between the sexes. Heavy alcohol consumption 
  was directly associated to aging among men, whereas the opposite tendency was 
  observed among women. It is interesting to note the contrast between this and 
  another Brazilian study<sup>9</sup> in which a similar association between alcohol 
  consumption and age was found among both men and women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Blacks and 
  mulattoes presented higher rates of heavy alcohol consumption, even after analysis 
  was adjusted, indicating the existence of ethnic and/or cultural differences 
  which cannot be explained by age and sex variables. Since skin color is one 
  of the determinants of socio-economic <i>status</i>, its effect cannot be controlled 
  by formal schooling or socio-economic level (mediating factors). Nonetheless, 
  this result is consistent with that encountered in other studies undertaken 
  in Brazil,<sup>3,7</sup> which established controls for socio-economic indicators 
  as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Alcoholism 
  and socio-economic indicators were inversely associated, as occurs in the majority 
  of the literature reviewed.<sup>3,7</sup> However, the only significant difference 
  was noted among the poorest individuals (class E). Although few years of schooling 
  was associated with heavy alcohol consumption in the crude analysis, in the 
  adjusted analysis this association was not significant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Cigarette 
  smokers presented greater prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption, particularly 
  heavy smokers. Although there is no causal relation between these variables, 
  this association is recurrent in the literature<sup>3</sup>. This result seems 
  to indicate that alcoholics tend to be more careless about their health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
  despite the limitations of the cross-sectional study, it was noted that people 
  who presented some form of chronic disease consumed more alcohol excessively 
  than other people. This is a cause of concern for it was found that these patients 
  had worse control of systemic arterial hypertension. This finding may be a consequence 
  of the deleterious effect of heavy alcohol consumption, as well as the lower 
  degree of personal health care presented by these individuals, since it was 
  also found that the number of visits to the health center was lower among this 
  population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Studies 
  similar to this one should be undertaken periodically in order to monitor the 
  tendencies of heavy alcohol consumption. However, ideally, they should be designed 
  in such a way as to make stratified analyses according to sex viable, given 
  that the findings suggest that there are different profiles of heavy alcohol 
  consumption between men and women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  indicate that black men, individuals within lower social and economic levels, 
  heavy cigarette smokers and people who present chronic diseases are the groups 
  which present higher frequencies of heavy alcohol consumption of alcohol and 
  who are therefore more susceptible to morbidity and mortality related to alcoholism. 
  Health activities, geared towards these groups, but preferably focused on the 
  entire population, should be planned in order to diminish heavy alcohol consumption 
  and, consequently, its harmful effects on health.</font></p>
