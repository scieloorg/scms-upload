<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To describe the methodology for evaluating habitual physical activity that 
  was adopted for a survey among the male population utilizing a questionnaire 
  validated earlier.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> The Baecke questionnaire on habitual physical activity was translated 
  into Portuguese and then back-translated into English by two anglophone teachers. 
  The final version of the questionnaire was applied in a cross-sectional epidemiological 
  study done on 326 men aged 50 years or over. The internal consistency among 
  the questions was evaluated using the Cronbach a statistic. The Spearman correlation 
  coefficients between the habitual physical activity scores were calculated. 
  Partial correlation coefficients with adjustments for age, body mass index and 
  schooling were also calculated.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> There was satisfactory internal consistency in relation to the 
  magnitudes of occupational physical activity and leisure-time physical exercises. 
  Significant correlation was obtained between all the physical activity scores 
  and the total habitual physical activity score, independent of age, body mass 
  index and schooling.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The Baecke questionnaire was found to be a practical instrument 
  for assessing habitual physical activity that is quickly applied and easily 
  understood, and it is recommended for epidemiological studies in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The search for methods for assessing physical activity in a population-based 
  context that would be accessible from the points of view of cost and ease of 
  application has stimulated researchers to develop questionnaires for evaluating 
  habitual physical activity (HPA). Caution is required in choosing the HPA questionnaire, 
  because such questionnaires need to cover all the peculiarities of HPA, which 
  may vary according to the environment, culture and sociodemographic characteristics 
  of populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There are now more than twenty HPA instruments listed in the literature, and 
  some of these are specific for adolescents, adult men and women, or elderly 
  people.<sup>20</sup> The Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> HPA questionnaire originated 
  in Holland and was published in 1982. It gives three scores for physical activity 
  over the last twelve months, which is characterized as occupational activities, 
  physical exercise and leisure-time and locomotive activities. This instrument 
  has been utilized in epidemiological research worldwide,<sup>3,4,10,15,20</sup> 
  and in Brazil it has been utilized with HPA score analyzed as a continuous quantitative 
  variable<sup>6-8</sup> and as a category variable.<sup>26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is structured in a qualitative-quantitative form on the Likert scale, taking 
  into account people's points of view regarding their physical activities. Furthermore, 
  it is easy to understand and fill out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of the present study was to describe the translation into Portuguese and the 
  internal consistency of the Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> HPA questionnaire, and 
  to describe the methodology for evaluating HPA that was adopted for a research 
  project that studied the factors related to bone mineral density among men aged 
  50 years or over.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Translation phase for the habitual physical activity questionnaire</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The authors of the Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> HPA questionnaire gave their permission 
  for a translation of the instrument. Once this permission had been obtained, 
  the translation phase was accomplished in three stages, following some recommendations 
  adapted from other studies.<sup>5,12,26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">First, the 
  original Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> questionnaire was translated from English 
  into Portuguese by two experienced researchers. A consensus on this translation 
  was reached after discussion with the researchers responsible for the project. 
  Next, back translation was performed by two English teachers born in the United 
  States and England. Once again, the researchers responsible for the project 
  compared the translations and discussed the discrepancies found. These discrepancies 
  were related to the adaptations of the wording in questions 1, 6, 8 and 9 of 
  the questionnaire. Finally, the group again contacted the authors of the original 
  questionnaire, to present the final results from the translation and the application 
  of the instrument.<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>*</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Validation and reproducibility</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The validation and reproducibility of the questionnaire were assessed among 
  male students in the sixth semester of the physical education course of the 
  Military Police School of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.<sup>9</sup> The scores 
  for leisure-time physical exercises, leisure-time activities and locomotion 
  and the total score were considered valid for measuring the frequency and intensity 
  of the practice of physical exercise, since this correlated significantly with 
  the physical exercise index, the percentage decrease in heart rate and the locomotive 
  activities index. The interviews were compared with a difference of 45 days, 
  and it was seen that the average scores were similar and the intraclass correlation 
  coefficients were greater than 0.69, thus demonstrating good reproducibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Habitual physical activity evaluation questionnaire</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> questionnaire investigates the HPA of the last 
  twelve months. This instrument is made up of 16 questions and covers three components 
  of physical activity: 1) OPA - occupational physical activities (Q<sub>1</sub> 
  to Q<sub>8</sub>); 2) LPE - leisure-time physical exercises (Q<sub>9</sub> to 
  Q<sub>12</sub>); and 3) LPA - leisure-time and locomotive physical activities 
  excluding physical exercise (Q<sub>13</sub> to Q<sub>16</sub>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">OPA is evaluated through questions 1 to 8. Question 1 considers the type of 
  occupation, which is classified into three levels of energy expenditure: light, 
  moderate or vigorous. For this classification, the Ainsworth<sup>1</sup> physical 
  activity compendium is recommended, since the professions cited in the original 
  article describing the questionnaire are not very comprehensive. Moreover, the 
  energy expenditure attributed to some of these professions is now out-of-date. 
  The other questions (2 to 8) relate to activities during work and are very objective, 
  inquiring whether the individual remains seated, remains standing, walks around, 
  carries heavy loads or feels tired after work, and a comparison is made with 
  how physical the work done by other persons of the same age is. For retired 
  people or those discharged from duties, a second occupational activity needs 
  to be considered.<sup>22</sup> If there is no second activity, adoption of a 
  score of 1.000 is recommended.<sup>20</sup> For domestic activities, adoption 
  of the moderate level in question 1 is recommended.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">LPE is evaluated in relation to the practice of regular physical exercise of 
  specific types (question 9), which is divided into three intensity levels according 
  to the energy expenditure: light, moderate or vigorous. For this classification, 
  the physical activity compendium cited earlier<sup>1</sup> is suggested. The 
  duration and frequency (hours per week and months per year) for each activity 
  are solicited. The specific score for question 9 is then calculated from the 
  intensity, frequency and duration. This score brings together another three 
  questions (10 to 12), relating to comparison of leisure-time physical activities 
  with those of other people of the same age, sweating during leisure time and 
  the irregular practice of physical activities during leisure time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">LPA is evaluated in relation to the activities of watching television (sedentary 
  activity), walking, cycling and, finally, the number of minutes spent per day 
  on locomotive activities (walking or using a bicycle to go to and come back 
  from work, school or shops)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The total score for HPA is the sum of the scores for OPA, LPE and LPA. For 
  questions not answered on the grids, it is recommended that the average value 
  from all the questions of the respective score is adopted.<sup>21</sup> The 
  formulae for calculating the scores can be found in Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> 
  (1982).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Methodology for the evaluation of habitual physical activity</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This was a cross-sectional epidemiological study. The data collection was performed 
  between March and October 1997, at the outpatient clinic of Hospital Heli&oacute;polis, 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo. This is a state-funded public hospital founded in 1969 
  that provides healthcare in various specialties. It attends to patients coming 
  from the southern region of the city of S&atilde;o Paulo and the cities of Santo 
  Andr&eacute;, S&atilde;o Bernardo, S&atilde;o Caetano and Diadema.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample was made up of 326 healthy male volunteers aged 50 years or over 
  who were not using medications that could have affected bone metabolism and 
  who did not have diseases like cancer, myeloma, hyperthyroidism or rheumatoid 
  disease. Invitations to participate in the study were issued through announcements 
  in the local newspaper and posters, to men who lived close to the outpatient 
  clinic of Hospital Heli&oacute;polis, whether or not they were attending the 
  clinic, and also to the husbands of women who were referred for bone densitometry 
  examination and male employees of the Heli&oacute;polis hospital complex.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Ethics Committee of Hospital Heli&oacute;polis and the Research Ethics 
  Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo 
  approved the research. Details of the methodology utilized are described in 
  previous work.<sup>6-8,13,25,28</sup> The HPA evaluation was done using the 
  questionnaire developed by Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> (1982).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This questionnaire was originally self-administered.<sup>2,19</sup> However, 
  in the present research, the people were interviewed because of the low level 
  of schooling among the study population. Such a procedure has already been utilized 
  in other research.<sup>10,20</sup> The time required for the interviews ranged 
  from five to ten minutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Statistical analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The characterization 
  of the study population was done using descriptive statistics. The internal 
  consistency of the instrument was analyzed using the Cronbach <font face="Symbol">a</font> 
  coefficient. The Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the 
  scores for OPA, LPE, LPA and total HPA, since the HPA scores did not have goodness 
  of fit to normal distribution, as evaluated via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
  Partial correlation coefficients between the scores were calculated, with adjustments 
  for age, body mass index (BMI) and schooling (in years). The analyses were done 
  using the SPSS software (version 10.0), and a significance level of 5% was adopted 
  for all analyses.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Evaluations were made on 326 men with a mean age of 62.5 years (standard deviation, 
  SD, of 7.9 years), with predominance of individuals in the age ranges of 50 
  to 59 years (42%) and 60 to 69 years (37.4%). The majority of the men was married 
  (86.8%), had white skin color (80.1%) and had not completed their basic education 
  up to eighth grade (73.6%). The mean BMI was 26.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD =4.1 
  kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and a large proportion of the men were overweight (42%) or 
  were considered to be obese (22%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was seen that only 28.2% of the participants said they had moderate or vigorous 
  energy expenditure in their jobs, and only 6.4% reported that they had practiced 
  physical exercises over the last twelve months. However, 67.8% of the interviewees 
  said they walked or cycled to get around, for a period of 30 minutes or more 
  per day. Half of the population (53.5%) said they watched television very often 
  during their leisure time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internal 
  frequency of the instrument is described in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. The 
  largest Cronbach <font face="Symbol">a</font> coefficients were between the 
  questions for the LPE score (<font face="Symbol">a</font>=0.45 or more). However, 
  it was seen that, if the question evaluating "sweating while practicing leisure-time 
  physical exercises" was removed, the internal consistency improved. In the questions 
  for the OPA score, the coefficients were low, especially in the questions about 
  remaining standing or walking around while working. On the other hand, the questions 
  about sitting at work and comparing the work with what other people were doing 
  presented good coefficients (respectively, <font face="Symbol">a</font>=0.60 
  and 0.52). Finally, there was great variability among the coefficients in the 
  questions for the LPA score (<font face="Symbol">a</font> from 0.13 to 0.50), 
  while it was noted that the internal consistency improved if the question about 
  "watching television during leisure time" was removed from the score.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> presents the correlation matrix for the HPA scores. The strongest correlations 
  were obtained between the total HPA score and the LPA score (r=0.78), followed 
  by the OPA score (r=0.70) and then the LPE score (r=0.60), even after adjustment 
  for age, BMI and level of schooling (respectively, r<sub>adj</sub> =0.77, r<sub>adj</sub> 
  =0.67 and r<sub>adj</sub> =0.67). Among the scores, the correlations were always 
  positive and weak (r&lt;0.31), although significant. The adjustments for age, 
  BMI and level of schooling altered the values of the correlation coefficients 
  very little.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The utilization 
  of the Baecke et al<sup>2</sup>questionnaire for evaluating HPA was shown to 
  be adequate for a study of the determinant factors for bone mass among men aged 
  50 years or over. It should be remembered that this questionnaire has already 
  been applied to men in another age group<sup>9</sup> and women,<a href="#back11"><sup>**</sup></a> 
  without problems occurring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Brazilian demographic census of 2000, out of the total number 
  of men aged 50 years or over, 54% were in the age range of 50 to 59 years, 77.4% 
  had studied up to seventh grade and 62% said they had white skin color. In the 
  present study, although the population consisted of volunteers, it presented 
  characteristics similar to the whole Brazilian male population (in the study, 
  42% were in the age range of 50 to 59 years, 73.6% had studied up to seventh 
  grade and 80% said they had white skin color). This contributed towards the 
  external validity of the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to the living standards survey made by the Brazilian Institute for Geography 
  and Statistics (IBGE) between 1996 and 1997,<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>***</sup></a> 
  the prevalence of overweight among Brazilian men aged over 45 years was 30.4% 
  and obesity 6.8% (average BMI of 24.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). These values were higher 
  than those in the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Questionnaires are an important method for evaluating HPA, considering their 
  low cost and ease of application.<sup>17</sup> The Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> 
  questionnaire is one of the few described in the literature that is structured 
  in a qualitative-quantitative manner on the Likert scale. This allows the individual 
  to be positioned in relation to daily life in the environment where he lives, 
  thereby offering better assessment of HPA.<sup>11</sup> Doubts have arisen regarding 
  the efficacy of utilizing HPA questionnaires among populations that differ from 
  those in which the questionnaire was originally validated.<sup>5,11,26</sup> 
  In the case of the Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> instrument, these problems did not 
  occur, given the objectivity of the questions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This instrument was developed in Holland,<sup>2</sup> and has been utilized 
  in epidemiological studies in countries like Belgium,<sup>3</sup> the United 
  States<sup>4,10,20</sup> and Croatia.<sup>15</sup> In Brazil, this instrument 
  was first used in the research project "Determinants of Bone Mineral Density 
  in Men", from which the results were published in Brazilian<sup>7</sup> and 
  international journals.<sup>8,25</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard specifically to the components of physical activities that the 
  scoring deals with, it can be seen that the occupational physical activity score 
  is extremely important for health assessments. From the time of the study made 
  among London Transport workers in 1953,<sup>16</sup> which showed a significant 
  inverse relationship between the levels of occupational physical activity and 
  cardiovascular diseases, evaluations of physical activity during work have been 
  included in epidemiological studies.<sup>17</sup> However, this type of physical 
  activity is difficult to evaluate because of the lack of an adequate instrument 
  for such investigation.<sup>12</sup> One alternative utilized has been to take 
  the type of occupation and base the assessment on the energy expenditure. Nevertheless, 
  this may result in errors, since the specific activities within the work are 
  not analyzed.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> occupational activity score, in addition to including 
  the type of occupation on the basis of the energy expenditure (first question), 
  evaluates other basic physical activities such as sitting, standing and walking 
  around at work, carrying heavy loads at work, feeling tired after work and sweating 
  at work, and also makes a comparison between the physical activity at work and 
  physical activities performed by other people in the same age group. Because 
  of this wide coverage, this score has been considered to be one of the most 
  appropriate for evaluating manual physical work.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present study, comprehension difficulties were restricted to the eighth 
  question, in which some people were unable to understand whether the expression 
  "physically heavy" referred to stress or energy expenditure. Pols et al<sup>22</sup> 
  (1995), studying Dutch men and women, also reported the same difficulty. In 
  the present study, in analyzing the internal consistency, there was an improvement 
  in the coefficient when question 2 was excluded. However, it was decided to 
  keep question 2 in the score, considering that the question of physical inactivity 
  relates to many professions. Furthermore, this question had a strong negative 
  correlation with the OPA score (r=-0.72; p&lt;0.001) (data not presented).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The evaluation of physical exercises performed during leisure time is one of 
  the most important evaluations in the field of public health, given that the 
  practice of regular physical exercise is a protective factor against various 
  chronic non-transmittable diseases and the risk factors for these diseases, 
  such as obesity and hyperlipidemia.<sup>18</sup> The Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> 
  physical exercise score seeks to fully investigate the types of exercise practiced 
  during leisure time. Question 9 (the first relating to the physical exercise 
  score) evaluates regular practice through a trio that is important in the physiology 
  of exercise: intensity, frequency and duration. The intensity is evaluated through 
  the type of exercise, the duration via the number of hours practiced per week 
  and the frequency via the number of months practiced per year. As a complement 
  for this score, the interviewees are asked for their points of view regarding 
  physical exercises during leisure time. There were some difficulties with the 
  responses to questions 10 and 12. As emphasized in other studies,<sup>22,23</sup> 
  because these are comparative and self-analytical questions, they may therefore 
  generate some difficulty in responses. In the analysis of the internal consistency, 
  there was an improvement in the coefficient when question 11 was excluded. However, 
  it was decided to keep question 11 in the score, considering the importance 
  of questions focusing on reported sweating or transpiration in the assessment 
  of HPA.<sup>24,27</sup> Furthermore, this question had a strong positive correlation 
  with the LPE score (r=0.80; p&lt;0.001) (data not presented).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The score relating to the leisure-time activities and locomotion is relevant 
  in the present context of epidemiology, in view of the benefits from daily practice 
  of physical activities lasting 30 minutes or more.<sup>18</sup> The term 'locomotion' 
  was included in this score, which is not cited in the literature, or in the 
  original article, considering that question 16 primarily evaluates transportation 
  activities on foot and by bicycle in daily activities like work, school and/or 
  shopping. With regard to the responses for this score, it was only in this last 
  question that there were some problems, principally in recording exactly how 
  many minutes per day were spent on these activities. In the analysis of the 
  internal consistency, there was an improvement in the coefficient when question 
  13 was excluded. However, it was decided to keep question 13 in the score, considering 
  the importance of evaluating the lack of physical exercises in the context of 
  leisure-time activities, as well as the strong negative correlation with the 
  LPA score (r=-0.88; p&lt;0.001) (data not presented).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The total HPA score is also an indicator that may be useful when the aim is 
  to evaluate all aspects of physical activities together, and it can be highlighted 
  that two studies in international journals have recommended its utilization.<sup>3,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The World Health Organization has proposed an international physical activity 
  questionnaire (IPAQ). The long and short forms of this have already been validated 
  on a sample of Brazilian volunteers aged over 12 years, living in the Greater 
  S&atilde;o Paulo region and with a level of schooling a little above the average 
  for Brazil.<sup>14</sup> Considering total physical activity, both forms have 
  shown good reproducibility after 3 to 10 days, although their validity was considered 
  to be low to moderate, in comparison with the <i>Computer Science &amp; Applications</i> 
  (CSA) movement sensor. According to these authors, the main limitations found 
  were difficulties in understanding the questions, for example, what a usual 
  or normal week means, or what moderate or vigorous physical activity consists 
  of. These authors also mentioned that there was difficulty in quantifying some 
  activities, such as sitting, and individuals tended to skip some questions or 
  give contradictory responses. The time taken to apply the long form was 8 to 
  20 minutes and the short form, 3 to 5 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The time 
  taken to apply the Baecke et al<sup>2</sup> questionnaire was 5 to 10 minutes 
  when utilized among a population of men aged 50 years or over with a low level 
  of schooling, and there was practically no difficulty in quantifying their activities. 
  Even when such difficulties have occurred, these studies have indicated solutions 
  and thus, international standardization has been ensured.<sup>20-23</sup> Moreover, 
  in the three studies in which this questionnaire has been utilized, the participants 
  could be placed within the Likert scale for almost all the questions, and thus 
  there was no need to make an interpretation, for example, of what vigorous or 
  moderate signifies.<sup>8,9,</sup><a name="top12"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>**</sup></a></font></p>
