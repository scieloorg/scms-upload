<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To determine the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in a population-based sample.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the State of Sergipe, 
  northeastern Brazil, in May and June, 1998. It involved 607 children aged 6 
  to 60 months. The information was obtained by means of interviews with the persons 
  responsible for these children, in their homes. Blood samples were collected 
  via venous puncture and serum retinol assays were carried out by means of high 
  performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In simultaneous analyses of the study 
  variables, p&lt;0.05 was accepted for testing statistically significant associations.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> A mean serum retinol value of 0.87 &#181;mol/l (&plusmn;0.38) 
  was found among the children investigated. The prevalence of levels considered 
  low (0.35 to 0.69 &#181;mol/l) was 22.5% and the prevalence of levels considered 
  deficient (&lt;0.35 &#181;mol/l) was 9.6%. Inadequate serum retinol levels 
  were therefore seen in 32.1% of the children. The serum retinol level showed 
  an association with per capita family income and the weight/age indicator. No 
  statistically significant association was found for serum retinol level in relation 
  to the child's age and sex, or the mother's variables.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSION: 
  </b>Vitamin A deficiency among preschool children is an important public health 
  problem. Hypovitaminosis A is mainly related to low per capita family income 
  and low infant weight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vitamin A is an 
  essential micronutrient in the processes of differentiation and maintenance 
  of epithelial integrity. It is especially known for the catastrophic effect 
  on vision caused by its deficiency. However, the disturbances associated with 
  deficiency of this vitamin are not restricted to blindness. There is also a 
  relationship with increased morbidity and mortality during childhood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hypovitaminosis 
  A is one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in the underdeveloped 
  world (FAO/WHO,<sup>6</sup> 1992; WHO,<sup>14</sup> 1995). On the basis of the 
  clinical occurrence of ocular signs and symptoms and the prevalence of deficient 
  levels of serum retinol, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 
  vitamin A deficiency is endemic in 39 countries (WHO,<sup>14</sup> 1995), including 
  Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this country, 
  it especially affects the northeastern region, particularly among preschool 
  children. The premise that the occurrence of hypovitaminosis A is restricted 
  solely to this region may not be true. Nonetheless, despite a lack of surveys 
  covering the whole country, the studies published have been unanimous in pointing 
  out that marginal lack of vitamin A is an important problem among preschool 
  children in northeastern Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO considers that 
  a prevalence of serum retinol levels &lt;0.70 &#181;mol/l occurring in 20% 
  or more of the population is indicative of a serious public health problem (WHO,<sup>15</sup> 
  1996). It is thought that 2.8 to 3 million children of preschool age around 
  the world are clinically affected by hypovitaminosis A, and that 251 million 
  present the subclinical form of this deficiency (WHO,<sup>14</sup> 1995).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations 
  Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United 
  Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have proclaimed the need to 
  institute programs for preventing and controlling this micronutrient deficiency. 
  Vitamin A reduces the mortality rate (Beaton,<sup>3</sup> 1993) and the incidence 
  and severity of infections, especially diarrheal diseases, among preschool children 
  (Barreto,<sup>2</sup> 1994).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The need to combat 
  vitamin A deficiency has gained a new dimension in recent years. Evidence of 
  hypovitaminosis A and xerophthalmia has been documented, especially in the northeastern 
  region of Brazil (Dricot D'ans et al<i>,</i><sup>5</sup> 1988; Santos et al,<sup>11</sup> 
  1996; INAN/MS-IMIP,<sup>7</sup> 1998). Even so, the data available on the prevalence 
  of vitamin A deficiency in this region are sparse. For the states of Piau&iacute;, 
  Maranh&atilde;o, Alagoas and Sergipe, there was no information available on 
  this problem until 1998.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  had the objective of estimating the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in a 
  representative sample of preschool children. This would furnish data to enable 
  the definition of public policies and the rationalization of resource application 
  in combating vitamin A deficiency.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was a cross-sectional 
  study performed in the State of Sergipe in May and June 1998. It formed part 
  of a broader investigation under the title of "Third Survey of Mother-Child 
  Health and Nutrition of the State of Sergipe", which was planned with the objective 
  of obtaining statewide health and nutrition indicators for children aged under 
  five years and women aged 15 to 49 years (SES/SE – UFBA,<sup>12</sup> 2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample size 
  (383 children) was calculated on the basis of a critical prevalence of vitamin 
  A deficiency of 20%. This rate is considered by the World Health Organization 
  (WHO) to be indicative of a serious public health problem. Variability of &plusmn;4% 
  in the estimate was accepted, with a 95% confidence interval. For this procedure, 
  the Epi Info 6.02 software was utilized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty clusters 
  in the 75 municipalities of the State were selected by means of a conglomerate-sampling 
  technique. The probability of selection was proportional to the size of the 
  under-five population , based on the 1996 population census by the Brazilian 
  Institute for Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e 
  Estat&iacute;stica - IBGE). By utilizing a combination of randomized and systematic 
  sampling techniques, eight census sectors were selected within each conglomerate, 
  stratified according to the urban and rural areas of each municipality, in accordance 
  with the sizes of their populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, 160 census 
  sectors in 16 municipalities were surveyed: 68.8% of them were located in urban 
  areas and 31.2% in rural areas. This distribution was compatible with what was 
  found by the 1996 IBGE census for the State: proportions of 70.2 and 29.8% of 
  the urban and rural populations respectively. In each census sector, a number 
  of homes sufficient to furnish a sample of six children were visited. When more 
  than one child within the age group for the study was found, one index child 
  was chosen at random. A sample totaling 607 children aged under five years was 
  thus obtained for the serum retinol analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the home 
  visit, specially trained nutritionists explained to the parents or guardians 
  what the purposes of the investigation were. These adults responsible for the 
  child remained free to decide whether or not the child should participate in 
  the study. Written informed consent was requested from these adults for the 
  collection of blood samples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The blood sample 
  collection was arranged for the day following the home visit, at an appropriate 
  location (healthcare unit or center). Guidance was given regarding the need 
  for the child not to eat before blood collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the children 
  were fasting, 5 ml of blood was collected by venous puncture using a disposable 
  needle and syringe. After removal of the coagulant, the blood was centrifuged 
  and an aliquot of the serum was stored in appropriate tubes. Following this, 
  the samples were frozen at -20ºC in the reference laboratory in the state 
  capital. This whole procedure was carried out under reduced illumination. The 
  samples collected in regions far from the state capital and/or in rural areas 
  were, after undergoing the process described above, duly conserved at -18ºC 
  in insulated chests lined with cold packs until they were moved to the laboratory. 
  After concluding the fieldwork, all the samples were transported to the nutrition 
  biochemistry laboratory of the School of Nutrition of the Federal University 
  of Bahia. The laboratory determinations of serum retinol levels were performed 
  by means of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, using 
  a Shimadzu chromatograph, model LC 10AS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The anthropometric 
  indicators of weight and height/length were obtained in accordance with the 
  technical recommendations in Lohman<sup>9</sup> (1988), with the use, respectively, 
  of portable electronic balances and anthropometers manufactured specially for 
  this purpose. The measurement instruments were calibrated before, and routinely 
  while, performing the fieldwork. The indicators utilized for the anthropometric 
  evaluation were weight-for-age and height-for-age. The cutoff point of less 
  than minus two standard deviations (&lt;-2 z-scores) in relation to the National 
  Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) reference was adopted for characterizing 
  malnutrition according to the indicators analyzed. Children at nutritional risk 
  and malnourished children who were identified during the investigation were 
  sent to the local healthcare service for the attendance needed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Data analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data collected 
  were entered into the Epi Info 6.02 software. Double data entry was done for 
  10% of the data. The prevalence and odds ratio (OR), respectively, were adopted 
  as the statistical measurements of occurrence and association. The Mantel-Haenszel 
  chi-squared test was used in the descriptive analysis, to test the statistical 
  significance between proportions. Logistic regression was utilized for simultaneous 
  analysis of the variables of interest, with the calculation of adjusted measurements. 
  Statistical significance of the associations analyzed was established on the 
  basis of p-values &lt;0.05. The SPSS for Windows 8.0 software was utilized for 
  statistical calculations, while anthropometric data was analyzed using the Epinut 
  module of the Epi Info 6.02 software.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ethical aspects 
  of the present study were approved by the Ministry of Health, Unicef and the 
  Ethics Committee of the Regional Medical Council of Sergipe.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was observed 
  that 22.5% of the preschool children presented serum retinol levels that were 
  considered low (0.35 to 0.69 &#181;mol/l), while levels considered deficient 
  (&lt;0.35 &#181;mol/l) were detected in 9.6% of the cases. In total, a 32.1% 
  prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was seen (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>). A mean serum retinol level of 0.87 &#181;mol/l was found (SD = 0.38) 
  among the children investigated. Classifying the children into age groups, the 
  mean serum retinol for children aged 6 to 24 months was 0.85 &#181;mol/l (SD=0.39) 
  and for those aged 25 to 60 months was 0.89 &#181;mol/l (SD=0.37). These mean 
  values are lower than those defined by WHO (=1.05 &#181;mol/l) to characterize 
  a normal nutritional state with regard to vitamin A.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the four 
  months preceding the survey, 9.3% of the children had been utilizing medications 
  containing vitamin A. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference 
  was observed between the serum retinol levels of these children and those who 
  had not been taking such medications (<font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup>=0.344; 
  p=0.558), thus indicating that this did not interfere in the prevalence found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution 
  of the serum retinol levels according to age group did not reach statistical 
  significance. Nonetheless, the children aged 6 to 24 months presented a higher 
  proportion (34.8%) of low and deficient serum retinol levels (defined as &lt;0.70 
  &#181;mol/l) than among the children aged 25 months or over (30.5%) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was seen that 
  the distribution of low and deficient serum retinol levels according to the 
  mother's schooling diminished as the schooling increased. However, no statistical 
  significance was detected between these variables (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>); a similar condition was observed in relation to the mother's age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Severe and moderate 
  anthropometric deficits (&lt;-2 z-scores) were identified in 10.0 and 11.5%, 
  respectively, of the preschool children investigated, when evaluated according 
  to the weight-for-age and height-for-age indicators. Among the children with 
  a deficit in relation to the weight-for-age indicator, 49.2% presented vitamin 
  A deficiency. Among eutrophic children, this prevalence dropped to 30.2% (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>). Deficits in the weight-for-age indicator (OR=2.235; 95% CI: 1.31-3.81) 
  were shown to be associated with deficient serum retinol levels in the bivariate 
  analysis (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 1</a>). Although no statistically 
  significant association was observed between the height-for-age indicator and 
  serum retinol levels, it was noted that children with a deficit in this indicator 
  presented a greater chance of having inadequate serum retinol levels than did 
  eutrophic children (OR=1.477; 95% CI: 0.88-2.46).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the per capita 
  family income was taken into consideration, a higher prevalence of serum retinol 
  deficiency was observed among the children who were classified in the lower 
  family income categories (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 1</a>). Bivariate 
  logistic regression analysis indicated that per capita family income situated 
  both in the range of 0.50-0.25 of a minimum salary (OR=1.741; 95% CI: 1.004-3.017) 
  and the range below 0.25 of a minimum salary (OR=1.888; 95% CI: 1.137-3.136) 
  were associated with a deficit in serum retinol levels (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21083_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After adjusting 
  the model to include only the variables for which the p-value was less than 
  30 in the bivariate analysis, the weight-for age anthropometric indicator and 
  per capita family income remained included. Although the category of the mother's 
  schooling presented a p-value greater than this, it was kept in the model because 
  of the known association between the mother's schooling and the child's nutritional 
  state. In fact, this procedure provided better adjustment and statistical significance 
  for the model. Thus, after the adjustment procedures, it was observed that a 
  deficit in the weight-for-age anthropometric indicator (defined as &lt;-2 z-scores) 
  raised the risk that the child would present inadequate vitamin A levels, in 
  comparison with eutrophic children, by a factor of 2.22 (95% CI: 1.035-4.761) 
  (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was also noted 
  that the chance that the child would present inadequate vitamin A levels was 
  1.87 times greater (95% CI: 1.086-3.208) when the per capita family income was 
  situated below 0.25 of a minimum salary, in comparison with children whose families 
  had per capita incomes greater than or equal to 0.50 of a minimum salary (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking into consideration 
  the revised WHO criteria<sup>15</sup> (1996), the prevalence of inadequate vitamin 
  A levels detected in this population (32.1%) implies that vitamin A deficiency 
  is an important health problem in the State of Sergipe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results obtained 
  provide evidence that vitamin A deficiency is also a public health problem for 
  yet another state in the northeast of Brazil, of dimensions that were, until 
  now, unknown. For other states in this region, vitamin A deficiency has already 
  been mapped out in some geographical areas. From a study selecting a representative 
  sample of the under-five population in the State of Pernambuco, it could be 
  seen that 19.3% of these children had serum retinol levels of less than 0.70 
  &#181;mol/l, and that 3% presented levels of less than 0.35 &#181;mol/l (INAN/MS-IMIP,<sup>7</sup> 
  1998). This is therefore a public health problem for that state. In the State 
  of Bahia, Santos et al<sup>11</sup> (1996), in a study carried out in the semi-arid 
  zone among children aged zero to 72 months, concluded that the lack of vitamin 
  A could be considered an important health problem in infancy, both because of 
  the prevalence of inadequate retinol levels (54.7%), and because of the magnitude 
  of dietary insufficiency. Assis et al<sup>1</sup> (1997), investigating children 
  aged 6 to 72 months in localities within the same region of the state, found 
  similar prevalences: 40.4% of the children had serum retinol levels that were 
  considered low (0.35-0.69 &#181;mol/l), and 4.3% had levels considered deficient 
  (&lt;0.35 &#181;mol/l). Only the results obtained by Diniz<sup>4</sup> (1997), 
  in a study using a representative sample of children aged less than five years 
  in the State of Para&iacute;ba, have shown that vitamin A deficiency could be 
  classified within the threshold of endemicity (prevalence of 16.0%). The author 
  attributed this lower prevalence to the periodic campaigns for administering 
  massive doses of vitamin A in that state.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present results 
  indicate that the occurrence of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children 
  in the State of Sergipe is similar to what is observed in other states in the 
  northeastern region. The results reinforce the argument that this deficiency 
  constitutes an important public health problem in the northeast of Brazil. They 
  put forward evidence that this group of children is exposed to higher risks 
  of morbidity-mortality during infancy, given the protective role that vitamin 
  A plays in the survival of preschool children (Beaton et al,<sup>3</sup> 1993).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Family income is 
  an indicator of structural processes in society and constitutes a determining 
  factor for the health and nutrition conditions of children and their families. 
  Thus, conditions of poverty represent risk factors for a series of nutritional 
  deficiencies, including vitamin A deficiency (ACC/SCN,<sup>10</sup> 1997). In 
  the present study, the per capita family income showed an inverse association 
  with the serum retinol levels, thus indicating that, as the per capita family 
  income decreases, the risk of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children 
  increases. In particular, income of less than 0.25 of a minimum salary, even 
  when adjusted for the other variables in the model, remained as a predictor 
  for such deficiency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  the economic and structural factors of the society in which the child and its 
  family live, other factors connected with conditions of morbidity also contribute 
  towards the depletion of serum retinol levels. Prominent among these are infections 
  that increase the requirement for or stimulate the endogenous loss of this micronutrient, 
  and also protein energy malnutrition, which affects the synthesis of retinol 
  binding protein (RBP). This protein has a short half-life (Lee et al,<sup>8</sup> 
  1993), thus diminishing the availability of retinol. In the present study, a 
  statistically significant association was observed between serum retinol levels 
  and anthropometric state when evaluated using the weight-for-age indicator. 
  This indicated that low weight increased the chance that the child would present 
  depleted serum retinol levels by a factor of 2.22.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over recent decades, 
  a significant reduction in the mortality rate and malnutrition prevalence during 
  infancy has been observed in Brazil. Nonetheless, the conditions of life, health 
  and nutrition among children in the northeastern region continue to be precarious 
  (Unicef,<sup>13</sup> 1995) and these conditions have been manifested in the 
  high rates of micronutrient deficiency, particularly in relation to vitamin 
  A and iron.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must furthermore 
  be taken into consideration that children who present a specific deficiency 
  in one micronutrient normally have multiple deficiencies. Malnutrition may also 
  be associated with other socioeconomic factors that contribute towards increasing 
  the weight-height deficit of such children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These results provide 
  strong evidence of the need for strengthening and organizing healthcare actions 
  so as to make them more effective, through the systematization of prevention 
  and treatment measures, in order to reduce the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency.</font></p>
