<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To assess the pollution of water bodies by domestic sewage and to evaluate the 
  basic sanitation conditions of residences and the knowledge of the local population 
  concerning intestinal parasitic diseases and the hazards they present to public 
  health.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Thirteen water samples were collected from each of four sites 
  in different water bodies of the Bairro da Serra region, in Iporanga, S&atilde;o 
  Paulo State. Rates of total and fecal coliforms were measured and median values 
  were presented so as to show domestic sewage contamination in the area. Questionnaires 
  were administered to 50% of local households in order to obtain information 
  on water supply and disposal of domestic sewage and solid waste, and to evaluate 
  knowledge of the transmission, health hazards, and prevention of intestinal 
  parasitic diseases among the local population.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The Betar&iacute; river showed microbiological indexes indicative 
  of pollution by domestic sewage. Higher levels were verified both upstream and 
  downstream from the Bairro da Serra. Median values were even higher in two of 
  the river's tributary streams, indicating strong pollution by domestic sewage 
  and lack of conformity with current legislation. In 91% of the households investigated, 
  sewage disposal was done by means of septic tanks, most of which were rudimentary 
  and contributed to the contamination of the environment. The knowledge of 62% 
  of interviewed subjects concerning the transmission of helminthic diseases was 
  considered as poor.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Our results indicate a risk of proliferation of intestinal 
  parasitoses and of other water-transmitted diseases, an issue which is aggravated 
  by increases in population caused by the region's vocation for ecotourism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intestinal parasitic 
  diseases are an important public health problem in developing countries. It 
  has been demonstrated that this problem is directly related to poor basic sanitation 
  and to the consequent degradation of the environment. Schooling and sanitary 
  knowledge within the affected population are also relevant factors. The resolution 
  of this problem has been prevented by the high costs involved in improving basic 
  sanitation, as well as by the lack of educational programs capable of achieving 
  community mobilization, which is fundamental for changing habits and beliefs 
  that contribute to the mechanisms of disease transmission, and often play a 
  role in social underdevelopment.<sup>5,6,10,14,16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present work 
  was aimed at verifying domestic sewage contamination in a river and two of its 
  affluent streams, evaluating basic sanitation conditions, and measuring local 
  residents' knowledge of intestinal parasitic diseases. This will allow us to 
  make inferences concerning the exposure of residents and tourists to these diseases.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ribeira Valley, 
  in the southern region of S&atilde;o Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil, includes 
  substantial areas of preserved Atlantic Forest, and accounts for 10% of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo State territory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The municipality 
  of Iporanga is located in the Alto Ribeira Valley, 360 km away from state capital 
  S&atilde;o Paulo, at latitude 24ºS and longitude 48º W, 
  on a branch of the Paranapiacaba mountain chain, part of the Brazilian coastal 
  mountain system.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ribeira Valley 
  is the poorest and least urbanized area in the State. Socioeconomic indicators 
  are unfavorable, and a large share of the population works in agriculture and 
  extraction.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The municipality 
  of Iporanga has 4,562 inhabitants and an area of 1,160.20 km<sup>2</sup>. Part 
  of its territory is located within the Alto Ribeira State Tourist Park (PETAR).<sup>8</sup> 
  This state preservation unit also includes part of Apia&iacute;, a neighboring 
  municipality, as well as the nearby <i>Bairro da Serra</i> neighborhood (<a href="#fig1">Figure</a>).</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig1"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21088_enf1.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An affluent of 
  the Ribeira de Iguape River, named Betar&iacute; River, runs through this neighborhood, 
  close to two of the preservation unit's headquarters. Due to its natural attractions 
  – which include caves, clear water creeks, and waterfalls – the Bairro da Serra 
  is under the influence of tourist visitation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are several 
  inns and camps in this area, in addition to other tourism-related services. 
  These novel economic activities are an important source of income for the local 
  residents, and are an economic alternative for the local population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bairro da Serra 
  neighborhood comprises approximately 110 residences and has about 600 inhabitants. 
  It was originally a rural settling, and its first inhabitants lived on agriculture, 
  palm heart (<i>Euterpe edulis</i>) and timber extraction, and mining, activities 
  which are currently in decline. An exception to this is a cluster of residences 
  alongside the SP-125 highway, with an urban-like configuration. This nucleus 
  has electricity, public and private telephones, a school, and a few commercial 
  establishments.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poverty of 
  the Ribeira Valley region is also seen in terms of basic sanitation, especially 
  in the rural areas. In the Bairro da Serra, ditches for pluvial drainage have 
  residues and odors typical of domestic sewage, indicating the precariousness 
  of sanitary sewage. Part of the sewage generated in these locations flows, untreated, 
  to small streams which lead to the Betar&iacute; river, a local tourist attraction 
  and a site of leisure, especially for children living in the area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water samples were 
  collected in order to determine the levels of total coliforms and of fecal coliforms 
  at sites considered to be under the influence of domestic sewage. Interviews 
  were conducted with residents at their homes in order to obtain data on basic 
  sanitation conditions and on the population's knowledge of intestinal parasitic 
  diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Four sites were 
  selected for the collection of water samples. The first site was in the Betar&iacute; 
  river, upstream from the Bairro da Serra, where the minimal water output is 
  4 m<sup>3</sup>/s.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> The second 
  and third sites were the Seco and Monjolo streams, branches of the Betar&iacute; 
  river that run through the more populous areas of the Bairro da Serra. These 
  are small streams flowing from springs, which during the draught season are 
  practically without current. The fourth collection site was also in the Betar&iacute; 
  river, downstream from the Bairro da Serra and from the confluence with the 
  Ga&uacute;cho stream, another small branch that runs through the neighborhood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirteen samples 
  were collected on a monthly basis, from February 2002 to February 2003. One 
  hundred milliliter samples were collected from the upper portion of the water 
  bodies in polyethylene flasks sterilized for at 120ºC for 15 minutes, 
  containing 0.1 ml of thiosulphate 18% and 0.3 ml of EDTA 15%. Samples were stored 
  at 2 to 8ºC in polystyrene boxes and sent to an environmental microbiology 
  laboratory for analysis. Analysis was performed using the multiple-tube method, 
  through determination of most likely number (MLN/100 ml) of bacteria of the 
  total coliform and fecal coliform groups. This technique consists in different 
  volumes and dilutions of inoculated water samples in lactose-rich medium in 
  series of five tubes, incubated at 35ºC for 24 hours for later verification 
  of gas production and subsequent quantitative estimation.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews were 
  conducted in June/July 2002. An adapted form of the questionnaire developed 
  by Gi&oacute;ia<sup>6</sup> (1996) was employed. Fifty-five households were 
  included, some of which were located in the regions of greater household density, 
  others which were located in lesser populated areas. The questionnaire comprised 
  questions concerning water origin and treatment, trash and sewage disposal, 
  and parasitic diseases (transmission of intestinal parasites, opinion about 
  intestinal parasites, and knowledge of prophylactic measures). Considering that 
  our study design required the inclusion 50% of the total households in the Bairro, 
  we chose to select half of the sample from each side of the river, with equal 
  spatial distribution across the neighborhood, in order to increase result reliability. 
  The questionnaire was administered to the head of the family in each of the 
  households visited. Field observations and research in the Iporanga Municipal 
  Sanitary Surveillance System were also carried out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Answers given to 
  the questions about helminthic diseases were evaluated and classified as coherent, 
  fair, or poor, according to the following criteria:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; The answer 
    to the question concerning the transmission of intestinal parasites was considered 
    as coherent, fair, or poor according to the mention of three or more, two, 
    or only one potential form of contamination by these parasites, respectively;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; The answer 
    to the question which qualified the subject's opinion regarding intestinal 
    parasites was evaluated as follows: coherent – answers that showed an awareness 
    of the seriousness of the issue at hand; fair – answers that included at least 
    one hazardous parasite; and poor – answers that failed to show an understanding 
    of the fact that intestinal parasitoses are diseases, rather than something 
    common to most people;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; The answer 
    to the question about knowledge of prophylactic measures was considered as 
    coherent, fair, or poor according to the mention of three or more, two, or 
    only one form of preventing contamination.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Answers were computed 
  as categorical variables based on descriptive analyses, and percentiles were 
  calculated. The Betar&iacute; river divides the Bairro da Serra into two parts, 
  which differ in terms of infrastructure. The SP-125 highway and the Betar&iacute; 
  river run parallel to each other. The river flows from Apia&iacute; to Iporanga. 
  Heading in this direction, the highway and the area of greater household density 
  are located on the right bank. This area is supplied with water by Sabesp, the 
  S&atilde;o Paulo State Basic Sanitation Company. On the left bank are the more 
  scattered households, which do not have water supply due to a conflict between 
  the Municipality and the Park with respect to the ownership of the area. Therefore, 
  when evaluating results, it is important to consider the distribution of households 
  between the left and right river banks.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We wish to emphasize 
  that the aim of the present study is to show results indicative of environmental 
  contamination by domestic sewage, and not of the behavioral parameters of the 
  river and its branches, as would be the case in a traditional limnologic study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21088_ent1.gif">Table</a> 
  shows the median of the thirteen sample collections from each site. The use 
  of the median attenuates the discrepancies generated by populational fluctuations 
  due to tourism and by environmental interference. The Ribeira Valley region 
  has high pluvial rates, which are related to the dilution of the pollutant concentrations 
  in water bodies. Therefore, spreading the samples across the entire period, 
  and using the median value for data presentation allows us to minimize the discrepancies 
  related to seasonal variations in the water flow of the bodies studied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the microbiological 
  parameters employed, 'total coliforms' include microorganisms that indicate 
  the occurrence of organic depuration, thus also being associated with domestic 
  sewage. Fecal coliforms, on the other hand, are directly associated with pollution 
  by domestic sewage, since these bacteria originate in the digestive tract of 
  warm-blooded animals.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to statute 
  20/86 of the National Council for the Environment, in order to be adequate for 
  domestic water supply, protection of aquatic communities, recreational activities 
  involving direct contact, and other usage appropriate to its water body category, 
  the Betar&iacute; river and its tributary streams must have levels up to 1,000 
  fecal coliforms per 100 ml or 5,000 total coliforms per 100 ml.<sup>3</sup> 
  The <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21088_ent1.gif">Table</a> shows that the collection site 
  upstream from the Bairro da Serra presents levels that may be associated with 
  sewage coming from nearby residences, as well as with the location of the Santana 
  Headquarters, which receives a large influx of tourists during certain periods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Seco and Monjolo 
  streams show high levels of pollution, according to the legal standards. This 
  is a consequence of the inadequate distribution of domestic sewage in the Bairro 
  da Serra (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21088_ent1.gif">Table</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  questionnaires, 69% of the households included in the survey had access to piped 
  water. Water in the remaining households was obtained from springs or directly 
  from the caves frequently visited by tourists and researchers. Of these, 22% 
  filtered water before use, 15% boiled it, and 62% did not employ any type of 
  water treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sabesp does not 
  provide sanitation to residences located on the left bank. Of the households 
  on that side of the river, 92% used spring water, and the remainder used water 
  from caves. The water supplied to residences with access to piped water complied 
  with the quality criteria established by the Ministry of Health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding sewage 
  disposal, 91% of the households included in the study released their sewage 
  into septic tanks, probably in a very rudimentary fashion. Of the remaining 
  households, 4% dispose of sewage on the ground or street, and 5% directly into 
  the river or stream. The precariousness of the septic tanks used is reflects 
  itself on the pollution of the streams.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue of final 
  garbage disposal is being dealt with more appropriately. Until 2002, all the 
  garbage collected in the municipality was sent to a dump on the bank of a tributary 
  of the Ribeira de Iguape river, close to the center of Iporanga. In 2002 a municipal 
  sanitary disposal unit was implemented. Our results show that garbage collection 
  takes place regularly in the Bairro da Serra; 83% of households dispose of solid 
  waste in plastic bags for collection, 2% in drums, also for collection, 13% 
  burn or bury their garbage, and 2% reported using organic residues for compost 
  and leaving the remainder for garbage collection. However, the municipal truck 
  collects garbage only from the right bank of the river. Left-bank residents 
  have to transport their waste to the other side of the river, which has an effect 
  on the numbers for this area: 61% of household waste is placed in plastic bags; 
  31% is burnt somewhere near the house, and 8% is buried without any prior treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the 
  transmission of intestinal parasitic diseases, only 5% of subjects had opinions 
  considered as coherent; 33% of opinions were considered as fair, and 62% as 
  poor. Regarding subjects opinions about parasites, 5% had opinions considered 
  as coherent, 27% as fair, and 68% as poor. As to prevention, 7% of subjects 
  showed coherent knowledge, 29% fair knowledge, and 64% poor knowledge.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of the 
  microbiological data presented above, it is possible to draw certain conclusions 
  regarding the pollution of the Betar&iacute; river by domestic sewage generated 
  in the Bairro da Serra.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The precariousness 
  in terms of basic sanitation, the pollution of water bodies, the lack of sanitary 
  knowledge among the population, and the prevalence of intestinal parasitoses 
  is a consequence of the regional context into which the area is inserted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historically speaking, 
  bibliographical records of the sanitation in the Ribeira Valley show that, in 
  1971, conditions in this respect were precarious: 82% of the population did 
  not have access to piped water and 95% to the sewage network. At the time, it 
  was reported that much of the valley's population did not wear shoes and drank 
  polluted water, thus constituting "easy prey for three to seven different types 
  of helminths". High rates of infant mortality were also reported, a problem 
  notoriously linked to sanitary conditions<sup>9,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hogan et al<sup>7</sup> 
  (2000) carried out a survey of demographical and sanitary conditions in the 
  Ribeira Valley, based on data from national censuses (conducted by IBGE, the 
  Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics). This study showed that, in 
  spite of the advancements in sanitary sewage disposal, in 1991 the Ribeira Valley 
  was still one of the most precarious regions in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo 
  in terms of basic sanitation.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2000 IBGE census 
  shows that, 53% of all residences in Iporanga have access to piped water and 
  40% have bathrooms or toilets connected to the main sewage network.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study conducted 
  in the municipality of Assis, S&atilde;o Paulo State, shows a correlation between 
  basic sanitary conditions and the prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases. 
  The authors verified the rates of water/sewage connection in the different areas 
  studied, and found a direct relationship in these areas with positive outcomes 
  for intestinal parasites in stool tests performed in the population.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An ethno-epidemiological 
  description of an indigenous population of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo showed 
  that polyparasitism is the rule among the subjects analyzed, being related mainly 
  to the sources and treatment of drinking water.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, a socioeconomic 
  threshold is assumed to exist, below which sanitation measures are not sufficiently 
  prophylactic. Such infections may also occur in the domestic environment, where 
  sanitary education, notions of hygiene, and cultural aspects are relevant to 
  the elimination of these diseases.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study investigating 
  the prevalence of intestinal parasitoses among the population of S&atilde;o 
  Jos&eacute; da Bela Vista, state of S&atilde;o Paulo, showed that, of 1,032 
  stool tests, 44.4% had positive outcomes, and that these were associated with 
  low family income and large family size, precarious personal and household hygiene 
  conditions, and poor knowledge concerning the prevention protozoan and helminthic 
  diseases.<sup>16</sup> Hence, population knowledge is one of the factors which 
  may lead to a reduction of the prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases. 
  Gioia (1995) conducted a parasitological survey at the Intervales Farm and surroundings 
  – the preservation unit immediately adjacent to PETAR. This area is very similar, 
  in terms of soil, climate, and human occupation patterns, to the Bairro da Serra 
  in Iporanga. Stool tests were performed on samples from 393 subjects (almost 
  the entire local population), and 72.5% of these harbored parasites or commensals, 
  with an average 2.3 different species per subject. Such rates were associated 
  with precarious knowledge and sanitation.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though the 
  helminths reported in the aforementioned studies were mostly geohelminths, which 
  do not directly require water in order to reach an infective state, the precariousness 
  of sewage disposal contributes to the perpetuation of the transmission mechanisms 
  of such parasites. However, the measurement of levels of pathogen cists and 
  eggs in water samples was abandoned due to the current legislation, which favors 
  the use of bacteria from the coliform group, acknowledging this parameter as 
  an indicator of the conditions of water bodies with respect to pollution and 
  contamination by domestic sewage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another statistic 
  relevant to the subject of parasitic diseases is related to schistosomiasis. 
  According to data from SUCEN (S&atilde;o Paulo State Superintendence for the 
  Control of Endemic Diseases, 2001), more than 200,000 cases of the disease were 
  notified in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo in the ten years preceding the survey. 
  Most of these cases were classified as 'imported', only 10% being autochthonous. 
  The Ribeira Valley is one of the main areas of transmission. However, for the 
  water bodies which were the subject of the present study, field observations 
  and queries to health agencies did not indicate the presence of planorbids of 
  the <i>Biomphalaria</i> genus – the intermediate hosts of <i>Schistosoma</i> 
  <i>mansoni</i>, the etiological agent of the disease.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned, the 
  Bairro da Serra is inserted into a region with longstanding problems, historically 
  precarious due to failures in socioeconomic development, and with few changes 
  in terms of the occurrence of such well-known problems as intestinal parasitic 
  diseases. The influx of tourists, which increases local population, especially 
  during holidays, aggravates environmental conditions and exposes tourists to 
  endemic diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Czeresnia &amp; 
  Ribeiro,<sup>4</sup> emphasize the importance of space to epidemiology. Space 
  not only allows for the circulation of pathogenic agents, but also promotes 
  the encounter of sources of contamination and populations in a condition of 
  risk due to economic, cultural and social factors. In this context, the tourist 
  can be considered as a potential introductory agent for non-endemic diseases, 
  due to his or her condition as a biological reservoir for pathogens that, upon 
  arrival, may be favored by the precariousness of the local scenario. As an example, 
  Silva<sup>12</sup> points out that the Eltor cholera biotype, disseminated as 
  a pandemic since 1961, has established itself endemically in several countries, 
  including Brazil. This fact is suggestive of the importance of spatial factors 
  in the endemic behavior of diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the solution 
  of the problem, the implementation of a basic sanitation structure in the area 
  has been arrested. There is a project for a joint venture between the Municipal 
  Government and Sabesp, in which the former would be in charge of building the 
  collection network, and the latter of building a sewage treatment facility. 
  However, the feasibility of such a project is barred by the matter of economic 
  viability, a crucial element for its implementation by the sanitation company.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still, the resumption 
  and conclusion of activities aimed at the removal, treatment, and disposal of 
  domestic sewage would be the most important measures for reverting such a situation 
  and its hazards to Public Health. These measures, which may be associated with 
  a sanitary education program, would be aimed at informing and at changing certain 
  habits of the local population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changes which took 
  place in terms of the generation of income, engaging local residents in the 
  tourism industry, increase the general awareness of the population. Silveira<sup>13</sup> 
  (2001) reports that, among these changes, there is an increasing concern regarding 
  the garbage and sewage network issues. These demands are fostered by the perception 
  of recent environmental issues in the Bairro, such as the pollution of streams 
  and the increase in waste production.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  we have verified that the perpetuation of the transmission cycles of intestinal 
  parasitic diseases is greatly favored by the conditions preponderant in the 
  area, which include waterborne transmission, among others. The presence of such 
  conditions renders the local population, especially children, at risk of contracting 
  infectious diseases, which are highly prevalent among Bairro da Serra residents. 
  This is not an easy problem to solve. Clinical care and medication are not sufficient, 
  since environmental contamination and population habits tend to favor the occurrence 
  of further systematic infections.</font></p>
