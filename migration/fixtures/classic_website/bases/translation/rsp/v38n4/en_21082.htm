<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  Mortality of diabetic patients is higher than that of the population at large, 
  and mainly results from cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of the study was 
  to identify the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with diabetes 
  mellitus (DM) or abnormal fasting glucose (FG) in order to guide health actions.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out in 
  a representative random cluster sampling of 1,066 adult urban population (=20 
  years) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul between 1999 and 2000. A structured 
  questionnaire on coronary risk factors was applied and sociodemographic characteristics 
  of all adults older than 20 years living in the same dwelling were collected. 
  Subjects were clinically evaluated and blood samples were obtained for measuring 
  total cholesterol and fasting glycemia. Statistical analysis was performed using 
  Stata 7 and a 5% significance level was set. Categorical variables were compared 
  by Pearson's chi-square and continuous variables were compared using Student's 
  t-test or Anova and multivariate analysis, all controlled for the cluster effect.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Of 992 subjects, 12.4% were diabetic and 7.4% had impaired fasting 
  glucose. Among the risk factors evaluated, subjects who presented any kind of 
  glucose homeostasis abnormality were at a higher prevalence of obesity (17.8, 
  29.2 and 35.3% in healthy subjects, impaired fasting glucose and DM respectively, 
  p&lt;0.001), hypertension (30.1, 56.3 and 50.5% in healthy subjects, impaired 
  fasting glucose and DM, respectively, p&lt;0.001), and hypercholesterolemia 
  (23.2, 35.1 and 39.5 in healthy subjects, impaired fasting glucose and DM respectively, 
  p=0.01).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSION: </b>Subjects with any kind of glucose homeostasis abnormality 
  represent a group, which preventive individual and population health policies 
  should target since they have higher prevalence of coronary artery disease risk 
  factors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heart disease is 
  accountable for up to 80% of mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. 
  In fact, the relative risk of death from heart events adjusted to age group 
  is three times higher in diabetics than that of the population in general.<sup>21</sup> 
  A recent observational study shows that the risk of death from coronary heart 
  disease in type 2 DM patients is similar to that for non-diabetics who have 
  suffered a prior acute myocardial infarction.<sup>8</sup> Women are generally 
  at a lower risk for heart disease than men, however for diabetic women this 
  is not so.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reasons for 
  accelerated evidence of arteriosclerosis in diabetic patients remain largely 
  unknown, however the putative mechanisms underlying accelerated arteriosclerosis 
  have been suggested to be the direct toxic effects of glucose on vasculature, 
  insulin resistance, and the association of DM with other risk factors.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is widely known 
  that type 2 DM is associated to a number of cardiovascular risk factors, including 
  systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), obesity, insulin resistance, microalbuminuria, 
  lipid and plasma lipoprotein abnormalities, in general, high triglyceride levels 
  and decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol). The 
  association of these risk factors has been called metabolic syndrome or X syndrome.<sup>17</sup> 
  The relationship between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease can be attributed 
  to the high prevalence of these risk factors in metabolic syndrome patients 
  or to a common precursor of all these factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Multiple Risk 
  Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) clearly confirmed that SAH, hypercholesterolemia 
  and smoking are independent predictive factors of mortality among patients with 
  cardiovascular disease, and the presence of at least one of these risk factors 
  has a greater impact on the mortality among diabetic patients than of that among 
  non-diabetics.<sup>21</sup> More recently, UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 
  results obtained in a comprehensive multi-centered study carried out in the 
  UK have confirmed the greater effect of the classical coronary heart disease 
  risk factors in diabetic patients.<sup>25</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A type 2 DM epidemic 
  has been taking place in the last few years and tends to spread in the next 
  decade.<sup>14,15</sup> Therefore, type 2 DM complications, among which cardiovascular 
  complications emerging as one of the greatest threats to health worldwide, represent 
  huge social and economic costs.<sup>4</sup> A recent study proved that changes 
  in patient lifestyle (exercising regularly and weight reduction) can decrease 
  the incidence of type 2 DM in glucose intolerant patients.<sup>2,24</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, identifying 
  the global risk profile of the population suffering from DM and from other glucose 
  homeostasis abnormalities is essential to develop health policies. The present 
  study aims at identifying the true prevalence of risk factors for coronary heart 
  disease in individuals showing different glucose homeostasis abnormalities.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is population-based 
  analytical observational cross-sectional study carried out in the state of Rio 
  Grande do Sul (RS). A database built for the original study was used to assess 
  the prevalence of risk factors for coronary heart disease in RS.<sup>7</sup> 
  The sample was composed of 1,066 subjects drawn from a cluster random sampling 
  according to the following parameters: 1) population size: infinite; 2) error 
  (absolute accuracy): 3%; 3) expected prevalence: 50% (maximum variability); 
  4) confidence level: 95%. To ensure the study would be representative of the 
  urban population in RS, the sample was calculated according to the population 
  of the municipality where each one of the 19 coordination offices of the State 
  Health Department were based, thus accounting for the 19 micro-regions in the 
  state.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  was conducted between July 1999 and October 2000. A structured questionnaire 
  on risk factors (lack of physical activity, diabetes, smoking, SAH, hypercholesterolemia) 
  and sociodemographic characteristics was applied to the adult population over 
  20 years of age in the selected area. Interviewers, nursing technical staff, 
  and medical students were trained according to the Joint National Committee<sup>19</sup> 
  (1997) standards to ensure correct blood pressure readings and adequate questionnaire 
  completion. Weight, height, and blood pressure measurements were recorded by 
  the interviewers. To determine fasting glucose and total blood cholesterol values 
  interviewers asked for blood samples after requiring subjects to fast eight 
  to 12 hours prior the testing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blood was drawn 
  according to standard procedures the day following the interview. Before being 
  frozen the samples were kept in fluoride tubes inside an ice cooler. Blood pressure 
  was measured twice during the home visit with an interval of at least three 
  minutes between the two readings. The second reading was recorded. The scales 
  and sphygmomanometers were Inmetro (National Institute of Metrology, Standardization 
  and Industrial Quality) adjusted and certified. All subjects signed a consent 
  form agreeing to the procedures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step was 
  to identify and compare risk factors. Therefore, subjects were classified into 
  three groups by their levels of glucose homeostasis: normal (fasting glucose 
  &lt;110 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose =110 e &lt;126 mg/dL) 
  or diabetic (fasting glucose =126 mg/dL or DM history or use of anti-diabetic 
  medication). Systemic arterial hypertension was ascertained if the subject had 
  blood pressure of =140/90 mmHg, or lower if under anti-hypertensive medication. 
  Hypercholesterolemia was ascertained if total blood cholesterol was =200 mg/dL. 
  Obesity was considered present if body mass index (BMI; calculated by dividing 
  weight in kilos by height in squared meters) was =30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects 
  who did not exercise at least three times a week were considered sedentary. 
  Current tobacco consumption, regardless of the number of cigarettes, was considered 
  smoking. Family income, number of family members, and having attended the public 
  health service in the last 12 months were also assessed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stata 7 statistical 
  software was used in the data analysis. Absolute and relative risk factor frequencies 
  were calculated, in addition to their distribution according to age group. The 
  data were expressed as means, confidence intervals or percentages. A 5% significance 
  level was set. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi-square 
  test. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test or Anova. All 
  of these statistic tests were bivariate and to control for effect of the study 
  design (cluster sampling) it was used various "svy" Stata commands, creating 
  clusters representing each one of the micro-regions in the state of RS. Logistic 
  regression models, controlled for the effect of the study design, were applied 
  to control for the effects of age and BMI on the associations found between 
  the risk factors and the degree of glucose homeostasis abnormality. These models 
  were used to separately compare healthy subjects to those presenting impaired 
  fasting glucose or diabetes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were studied 
  1,063 out of 1,066 subjects initially selected. This represented a loss of 0.3%. 
  Of these, there were complete data on 992 subjects, thus representing 93% of 
  the total sample, to classify them in three different groups according to the 
  level of glucose homeostasis. Representativeness of the adult urban population 
  was evidenced by comparing the demographic data of the sample to the 2000 Population 
  Census carried out by the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (Instituto 
  Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica, IBGE).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average age 
  of the sample was 44 years (95%CI: 41.3–46.5), with 18% of the sample being 
  over the age of 60, 47.4% were male. Approximately 74% had family income equal 
  to or less than six minimum wages, while 42% had a family income equal to or 
  less than three minimum wages. About 42% of the sample did not finish elementary 
  and junior high school education (less than eight years of schooling). <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21082_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a> shows the main features according to gender. There were statistically 
  significant differences in schooling and family income (both lower in women) 
  when related to having attended the public health service in the last year (greater 
  for women) and to the presence of higher levels of total cholesterol and women 
  in the older age group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diabetic prevalence 
  was 12.4% (N=123), while 7.4% (N=74) presented impaired fasting glucose. In 
  the diabetic group, 31.7% (N=39) were not aware of their disease. The <a href="#fig1">figure</a> 
  shows the direct association between older age and higher DM prevalence and 
  impaired fasting glucose, as well as hypercholesterolemia, and systemic arterial 
  hypertension.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21082_ent2.gif">Table 
  2</a> compares risk factors for coronary heart disease among diabetics, subjects 
  with impaired fasting glucose and healthy subjects. When comparing the three 
  groups, subjects with impaired fasting glucose and diabetes presented a statistically 
  significant association to older age, BMI index, in addition to obesity, SAH, 
  and hypercholesterolemia. The post hoc analysis showed that subjects with impaired 
  fasting glucose were older, had a higher prevalence of SAH, hypercholesterolemia, 
  and obesity. Both the group of subjects with impaired fasting glucose and the 
  diabetic group had sought the public health service significantly more often.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gender, family 
  income, schooling, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, lack of physical activity, 
  and obesity were not different among subjects who were not aware of being diabetic 
  from those who had already been diagnosed as such. However, the latter showed 
  a lower fasting glucose than the former (137.8 mg/dL <i>vs</i> 182.7 mg/dL, 
  p=0.004). They also had a lower prevalence of smoking (26.2% <i>vs</i> 41%, 
  p=0.04). These data are shown in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21082t3.gif">Table 3</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to control 
  for the effect of age and BMI on SAH prevalence and blood cholesterol levels 
  among healthy subjects and those with impaired fasting glucose, odds ratios 
  were calculated by using logistic regression models. There is an association 
  between SAH (OR=1.93, 95% CI=1.07-3.48) and impaired fasting glucose, regardless 
  of age and BMI, but there is no association to blood cholesterol levels (OR=1.16, 
  95% CI=0.74-1.83). While comparing healthy to diabetic subjects, also by logistic 
  regression analysis, it was not observed an independent association of age and 
  BMI between SAH (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.61-1.53) and high cholesterol (OR=1.49, 95% 
  CI=0.94-2.37) and diabetes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of diabetes found in this sample was greater than that found by Malerbi et al<sup>12</sup> 
  in Porto Alegre in 1992 (8.9%). Data in the present study were based on new 
  diagnosis criteria having lower fasting glucose cut-offs than the one adopted 
  in the study mentioned above (126 mg/dL <i>vs</i> 140 mg/dL). However, the great 
  majority of patients diagnosed as diabetics in Malerbi et al. study were considered 
  so because glycemia was greater than 200 mg/dL after oral glucose tolerance 
  test (75 g). It is known that this criterion is equivalent, in regard to the 
  prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, to the one using fasting glycemia greater 
  than 126 mg/dL. Both studies considered the patients who, despite presenting 
  fasting glycemia levels lower than the above-mentioned levels, reported a previous 
  history of diabetes and anti-diabetic medication use. It should be taking into 
  consideration, though, that the current study encompassed a sample of the whole 
  adult urban population in RS, while the previous only included a sample of the 
  city of Porto Alegre. This increase in the prevalence of diabetes can be compared 
  to what has been taking place in developed and developing countries.<sup>14,16,22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is likely that 
  this increase in the prevalence of diabetes is a consequence of the established 
  prevalence of obesity in Brazil according to three comprehensive cross-sectional 
  studies carried out between 1975 and 1997.<sup>15</sup> High obesity in the 
  target population in both sexes reinforces this hypothesis. In addition, it 
  was observed a higher BMI and a higher obesity rate among subjects with some 
  degree of glucose homeostasis abnormality (diabetes or impaired fasting glucose).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High obesity rates 
  were observed in the state of RS (19.5 and 21.8% in men and women respectively) 
  than in Brazil as a whole (6.9 and 12.5% in men and women respectively).<sup>15</sup> 
  Despite the higher prevalence of diabetes in RS when compared to the 1992 study, 
  this higher prevalence is still lower than expected because of the high number 
  of obese subjects. Other determining factors for impairment of glucose homeostasis 
  besides obesity (diabetes genetic predisposition, insulin resistance) are not 
  likely to been so frequent. The low prevalence of type 2 diabetes in relation 
  to the high prevalence of obesity has been recently reported in a rural population 
  in Chile.<sup>18</sup> In other regions of Brazil, in a specific subpopulation,<sup>3</sup> 
  the increase in the incidence of diabetes was parallel to the increase in obesity, 
  thus regional differences in factors determining diabetes, besides obesity, 
  are operating factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Impairments of 
  glucose homeostasis still not considered to be diagnostic of diabetes were observed 
  in 7.4% of the subjects in this study, which is lower than the proportion found 
  in Porto Alegre in 1992 (12.2%).<sup>12</sup> Data of the present study are 
  based on the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association,<sup>6</sup> 
  which introduces the impaired fasting glucose category (fasting glycemia between 
  110 mg/dL and 126 mg/dL). The previous data were based on glucose tolerance 
  test results. The impaired fasting glucose category is suggested to be equivalent 
  to the glucose intolerance, but this has not been evidenced. Subjects with high 
  risk of cardiovascular disease would be better identified by glucose tolerance 
  tests since 30% of subjects with high blood glucose after being subject to this 
  test present fasting glycemia lower than 100 mg/dL.<sup>1</sup> Subjects with 
  impaired fasting glucose present lower cardiovascular mortality than those with 
  diabetes or glucose intolerance.<sup>23</sup> Despite the controversy in regard 
  to diagnosing diabetes,<sup>1,6</sup> fasting glycemia testing is more economic 
  and easier to perform, thus being preferred in studies with a great number of 
  subjects, such as this one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was seen a lower 
  number of diabetic subjects who were not aware of their condition before the 
  study: 46% in the Brazilian Diabetes Census<sup>12</sup> compared to 31.7% in 
  the present study. These proportions indicate that measures taken by the Brazilian 
  Ministry of Health<sup>13</sup> aiming at diagnosing diabetes have been effective, 
  at least in RS. Considering the high costs of treating the chronic complications 
  of diabetes, which tend to occur in up to 50% of type 2 diabetics at the time 
  of diagnosis,<sup>26</sup> it is essential that effective measures well-known 
  to prevent diabetes (weight reduction and physical exercises)<sup>2,24</sup> 
  be put in practice after an early diagnosis through glucose homeostasis evaluation. 
  The new strategies recently proposed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health are 
  very important in this context.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase in 
  the number of subjects with some kind of glucose homeostasis abnormality compared 
  to age increase reinforces previous information on glucose tolerance decreasing 
  as people age. These data are shown in this study both by the higher average 
  age in the impaired fasting glucose group as well as in the diabetic group, 
  in addition to the higher percentage of subjects over 60 years of age in these 
  groups. The same can be said on the greater number of subjects with hypertension 
  and hypercholesterolemia in the older age groups, according to previous data 
  from other populations.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smaller number 
  of smokers among diabetic subjects was already expected, seeing that they are 
  a subgroup that knowingly attends health services more than non-diabetic subjects. 
  Thus, the former are targeted by measures aimed at preventing the chronic complications 
  of diabetes, including quitting smoking.<sup>11,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Characteristically, 
  type 2 diabetics present higher triglyceride levels and lower HDL cholesterol 
  without, however, they do not present higher levels of low-density lipoprotein 
  cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) than expected for the general population.<sup>17</sup> 
  Data of the present study showed higher total cholesterol for diabetic subjects, 
  but this association was not confirmed when controlled for BMI and age. However, 
  even though it can not be determined a causal relation between diabetes or impaired 
  fasting glucose and increase in total cholesterol, the association of these 
  variables, and particularly that both depended on subjects' overweight, is extremely 
  relevant to the goals to be attained in caring for this population. These goals 
  should be mainly based on preventing obesity through educational measures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects with some 
  degree of glucose homeostasis abnormality presented a higher SAH prevalence, 
  which was no longer seen when the multivariate analysis was performed, controlling 
  for the effects of age and BMI. However, the association of higher SAH prevalence 
  remained unchanged in the impaired fasting glucose group. Considering the rich 
  literature data concerning the association of diabetes to SAH,<sup>5,10</sup> 
  the differences in the study data can be attributed to the greater concern diabetics 
  have with their health and, therefore, there is a greater chance their pressure 
  levels are under control. This hypothesis is strengthened by the higher number 
  of diabetic patients attending the public health system in the last year (63.4%) 
  compared to non-diabetics (51.1%) and those with impaired fasting glucose (57.1%). 
  As previously mentioned, there is no support for a causal relation between diabetes 
  and SAH, but their association is fact, just as these variables depend on the 
  presence of overweight. Therefore, the same measures taken to prevent obesity 
  shall impact on a lower number of hypertension subjects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  on the prevalence of risk factors in a subpopulation of subjects with high risk 
  for coronary disease (glucose homeostasis abnormalities) highlights the importance 
  of diagnosing and, at a second stage, monitoring the subjects for complications 
  frequently seen. Identifying these subjects as a target group is essential to 
  establishing preventive measures at the individual and population level. At 
  an earlier stage still, the ideal intervention for preventing diabetes, hypertension 
  and dyslipidemia can be carried out partially by health programs which target 
  high risk populations (particularly subjects with overweigh and obesity) by 
  encouraging physical activities and weight reduction.</font></p>
