<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To evaluate excess mortality due to infectious diarrhea without etiological 
  diagnosis, occurring simultaneously to Vibrio cholerae circulation.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Statistical modeling was applied to a time series of deaths 
  ascribed to "poorly defined intestinal infections" (International Classification 
  of Diseases – ICD-9) and "presumably infectious diarrhea and gastroenteritis" 
  (ICD-10), between 1980 and 1998 in the Northeast Region of Brazil. The prediction 
  of expected values was obtained after a discontinuity point. Excess mortality 
  was calculated as the difference between observed figures and those estimated 
  by the model.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Between 1992 and 1994, only 19.3% of deaths by cholera were 
  actually notified. In 1993, the year in which the epidemic reached its peak 
  in the area, our modeling estimated underregistration at 82.2%.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Results indicate substantial underregistration of cholera 
  mortality during the epidemic in Northeastern Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current evaluations 
  of the health and living conditions of the Brazilian population suggest an extremely 
  concerning scenario, related to the superposition of distinct patterns of morbidity 
  and mortality, in which the advance of the so called 'modern' patterns – chronic 
  degenerative diseases and violence, among others – is combined with the persistence 
  of patterns associated with underdevelopment, such as infectious and parasitic 
  diseases.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a short period, 
  there has been a significant reduction in the participation of infectious and 
  parasitic diseases in Brazilian mortality statistics. This type of disease fell 
  from second place in the ranking of the most important causes of death in 1977 
  to fifth place in 1984, and mortality levels decreased from 9.3% of all deaths 
  in 1980 to 7.6% in 1984.<sup>11</sup> In 1996, 1997, and 1998, infectious and 
  parasitic diseases were the sixth most important cause of death in Brazil, accounting 
  for 5.8%, 5.3%, and 5.2% of all deaths countrywide, respectively. One of the 
  factors contributing to such a reduction was the increasing accessibility of 
  certain essential goods and services, which, however, were still unequally distributed, 
  being concentrated in more developed regions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notwithstanding, 
  deaths associated with infectious and parasitic diseases in the Northeast Region 
  of Brazil are still an important component in the structure of infant and childhood 
  mortality, officially accounting for approximately 16.5% of all deaths in these 
  groups. The actual toll of these diseases is likely to be even higher, since 
  in this region there is still a high proportion of deaths attributed to poorly 
  defined causes – 22% of all deaths in 1998. This may be masking the actual percentage 
  of deaths by infectious and parasitic diseases, since poorly defined causes 
  are found predominantly among individuals from poorer social groups, to whom 
  medical care is not always available during the entire process of illness and 
  death.<sup>13</sup> According to Werneck &amp; Reichenheim,<sup>16</sup> diseases 
  with greater impact on infant mortality are usually underestimated when only 
  the proportion of deaths is analyzed. This is demonstrated by studies on the 
  loss of potential years of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinically, cholera 
  is an acute diarrheic disease, which can lead to the loss of several liters 
  of water and electrolytes in a period of a few hours, which may culminate in 
  a clinical scenario of hypovolemic shock and death, in case these losses are 
  not readily restored.<sup>5</sup> In Brazil, 1,918 cases of cholera were reported 
  to the Ministry of Health's National Sanitary Surveillance System (SNVE) between 
  1991 and 1998. In the same period, the Mortality Information System (SIM), run 
  by the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System 
  (DATASUS), registered 1,295 deaths (66,8%), which leads us to the assumption 
  that there has been substantial underreporting of cholera deaths in the country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An evaluation of 
  the impact of <i>V. cholerae</i> circulation on mortality may be carried out 
  indirectly through statistical modeling. This can be done by estimating the 
  number of excess deaths during the epidemic period, calculated as the difference 
  between the number of deaths observed and the number of deaths expected in a 
  non-epidemic scenario. This approach has been successful in studying the impact 
  of the Influenza virus and the deleterious effects of atmospheric pollution.<sup>6,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  is aimed at evaluating excess mortality due to infectious diarrhea without etiological 
  diagnosis in the Northeast Region of Brazil, during the period of circulation 
  of <i>V. cholerae</i> in this region.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A time series of 
  the deaths ascribed to "poorly defined intestinal infections" (International 
  Classification of Diseases – ICD-9) for the 1980-1995 period, and to "presumably 
  infectious diarrhea and gastroenteritis" (ICD-10) for the 1996-1998 period, 
  was obtained form the Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System (SIM). 
  The complete time series was used for estimating the point of discontinuity 
  its structure. To this end, we employed a local stationary autoregressive model 
  and the Akaike information criteria (AIC) minimum value. Once the discontinuity 
  point was estimated, data from the previous time series were modeled through 
  decomposition into three components: local polynomial trend, global stationary 
  autoregression, and random error. The AIC minimum value was used for selecting 
  the best model.<sup>7</sup> Model parameters were estimated using Kyplot software. 
  The adjusted model was used for predicting expected values after the point of 
  discontinuity. Excess mortality was calculated as the difference between the 
  observed figures and those estimated by the model.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time series 
  of deaths by infectious diarrhea without etiological diagnosis in the Northeast 
  Region of Brazil between 1980 and 1993 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), shows 
  that the number of deaths declined continuously until 1992 – the first year 
  of the cholera epidemic in the region – when this trend was reversed. From then 
  on the variation in the number of such deaths follows the incidence of cholera.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The point of discontinuity 
  in the behavior of the time series identified by the model was 1991, as shown 
  in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. The work of Kitagawa &amp; Gersch<sup>7</sup>

  based on the limits of the confidence interval and on the number of cholera 
  deaths registered by SIM.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The choice of statistical 
  method was due to the greater appropriateness of this model for use in time 
  series with important trends, in comparison with the Arima method proposed by 
  Box &amp; Jenkins,<sup>2</sup> which is more appropriate for stationary series. 
  Another advantage of the present method is the semi-automatic character of the 
  choice between the different possible models based on the minimum AIC. This 
  is strengthened by the model's good prediction of the last years of the time 
  series, despite it being a seven-year prediction based on an eleven-year period. 
  The appropriateness of this model, even when dealing with short series, is one 
  of its advantages.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our results indicate 
  substantial underregistration of cholera mortality during the epidemic in the 
  Northeast Region. Assuming that the excess mortality between 1992 and 1994 was 
  indeed caused by cholera, this would mean that only 19.3% of cholera cases in 
  the period were actually reported. For 1993, the year in which the epidemic 
  reached its peak in the Northeast, the present modeling estimated underregistration 
  at 82.2% (69.4-86.8%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortality attributable 
  to influenza, heat, and atmospheric pollution is traditionally calculated by 
  statistical models based on the estimation of excess mortality.<sup>14,15</sup> 
  As in the present case, there is no definitive proof in these studies that such 
  deaths were indeed due to influenza, or to the other events mentioned. Nevertheless, 
  the biological logic which supports these studies, along with the disappearance 
  of excess mortality upon termination of the event at hand, support the hypotheses 
  proposed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number and 
  percentage of deaths ascribed to poorly defined causes decreased throughout 
  the entire study period, form 48.6% in 1980 and 42.1% in 1990 to 34.4% in 1995 
  and finally to 28.8% in 1998.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated 
  that roughly 20% of all deaths in Brazil are not registered, and that this proportion 
  exceeds 50% in certain areas of the Northeast Region. This region also shows 
  the highest levels of deaths attributed to poorly defined causes.<sup>10</sup> 
  Considering that the present study was based on registered deaths with well 
  defined underlying causes, the numbers here presented, although quite high, 
  probably still do not reflect the actual excess mortality brought about by cholera 
  in this region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until 1991, the 
  Ministry of Health lacked a structure responsible for developing activities 
  related to the epidemiological surveillance of diarrhea. As states and municipalities 
  tend to reproduce the model developed at the Federal level, there were, apart 
  from rare exceptions, no activities in Brazil aimed at studying and understanding 
  diarrheas, despite the awareness of the impact of these diseases on the population. 
  With the emergence of cholera, such a structure was implemented as an emergency 
  measure; however, due to operational issues, this structure still works precariously 
  and with extreme difficulty in detecting and reporting cases of cholera, especially 
  those from remote regions. With respect to assistance, despite the large investments 
  made in the management of diarrheas and dehydration, a study conducted in nine 
  Brazilian capitals showed that a large proportion of the care provided is inadequate.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to World 
  Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, all suspect cases reported were confirmed 
  based on laboratory (positive stool test for <i>V. cholerae</i>) or clinical-epidemiological 
  criteria (with or without negative stool tests, but with clinical aspects and 
  epidemiological antecedents compatible with the disease). These criteria are 
  described in detail elsewhere.<sup>8</sup> Due to a political decision, in 1991 
  and early 1992, the National Committee for the Prevention and Control of Cholera 
  (CNPC) – responsible, at the time, for all activities related to controlling 
  the epidemic in the country – only counted cases which had been confirmed by 
  laboratory exams (namely, positive stool culture for <i>V. cholerae</i>), even 
  in areas in which the circulation of this agent had already been established. 
  In the subsequent period, in spite of changes in orientation promoted by the 
  Ministry of Health, still very few cases were confirmed based on the clinical-epidemiological 
  criterion, in all Brazilian states. The states in the Northeast Region, with 
  the exception of Pernambuco and Bahia, confirmed more than 50% of their cholera 
  cases by laboratory testing. This proportion was as high as 85%, or even higher, 
  in the states of Maranh&atilde;o, Para&iacute;ba, Piau&iacute;, and Sergipe.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inconvenience 
  of chemoprophylaxis for contacts of cholera patients is widely described in 
  the international literature. In addition to its failure to restrict the dissemination 
  of the disease in the population, chemoprophylaxis may easily lead to the emergence 
  of strains resistant to the antibiotics used, rendering inefficient a weapon 
  designed to be used in severe cases, mainly for reducing disease lethality. 
  Its widespread use in Brazil has also led to the failure to diagnose a large 
  number of cases, since the use of antibiotics before the collection of rectal 
  swab samples leads to negative test results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortality statistics 
  are an important element in diagnosis and healthcare policy making, and the 
  death certificate is the main source of data for these statistics.<sup>1</sup> 
  Using SIM data for planning measures in the field of epidemiological surveillance 
  is a limited approach, mainly because of the two to three-year lag between death 
  notification and the availability of data at federal level. This does not prevent 
  the use of this information at municipal level, in real time, as an important 
  monitoring instrument for the early identification of alterations in the health 
  conditions of the population. In the specific case of cholera, an increase in 
  the number of deaths due to diarrhea is an important alert for the early detection 
  of outbreaks of the disease.</font></p>
