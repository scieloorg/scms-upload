<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To assess the relationship between hemoglobin concentration and breastfeeding 
  and complementary feeding during the first years of life.<br>
  <b>METHOD: </b>Cross-sectional study with 553 children under age 12 months, 
  who attended public healthcare facilities. Hemoglobin concentration was measured 
  by the cyanmethaemoglobin method, using the HemoCue system. Associations of 
  interest were analyzed through multiple linear regression.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Hemoglobin concentrations compatible with anemia were identified 
  in 62.8% of the children studied, with greater occurrence among the 6-12 months 
  age group (72.6%). Exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life 
  was associated with the highest levels of hemoglobin. The remaining feeding 
  regimes were associated with different levels of reduction in hemoglobin levels, 
  which became compatible with anemia in children fed with formula (p=0,009). 
  Tea and/or water consumption was associated with a reduction in hemoglobin concentration 
  of 0.76 g/dl (p&lt;0,001) among children under age 6 months. For children aged 
  6-12 months, hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly with the consumption 
  of sugar (p=0.017) and beans (p=0.018), and decreased significantly with the 
  consumption of fruit (p&lt;0.001).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSION: </b>Exclusive breastfeeding until age 6 months and continuation 
  of breastfeeding after this age, combined with qualitatively and quantitatively 
  appropriate feeding may contribute towards an increase in hemoglobin concentration 
  in the first year of life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anemia is a highly 
  prevalent disease worldwide, but rates are highest in developing countries (ACC/SCN,<sup>1</sup> 
  1997). Several factors, including low consumption of iron-rich foods, parasitic 
  and infectious diseases, genetic background, and interactions with other micronutrients 
  may impair normal hemoglobin synthesis. However, in areas where the prevalence 
  of anemia is high (above 50%), the most common cause of this condition is the 
  low bioavailability of dietary iron (ACC/SCN,<sup>1</sup> 1997). In spite of 
  the existence of several indicators for diagnosing anemia at the population 
  level, the indicator most frequently used is hemoglobin concentration, with 
  its specific cutoff points for different age groups and physiological conditions 
  (WHO,<sup>19</sup> 2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pregnant women 
  and children during growth stages are the groups most vulnerable to iron deficiency 
  anemia. The highest prevalence is detected among children in the 6 to 24 month 
  age group, a period which coincides with the termination of breastfeeding. There 
  is also evidence that the occurrence of anemia decreases as the child grows, 
  even though anemia is still an important health problem among preschool children 
  (ACC/SCN,<sup>2</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent studies 
  conducted in various Brazilian capitals show an increasing trend in the prevalence 
  of anemia among preschool children (Monteiro et al,<sup>10</sup> 2000; Oliveira 
  et al,<sup>11</sup> 2002). In epidemiological terms, these are important results, 
  since anemia has negative effects on psychomotor development and child learning 
  (ACC/SCN,<sup>2</sup> 2000) and depresses the immune response (Scrimshaw &amp; 
  SanGiovanni,<sup>13</sup> 1997).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major factors contributing 
  to the decline of hemoglobin levels during the first year of life include low 
  fetal iron reserves and short duration of breastfeeding. These are combined 
  with the consumption of foods of low energetic density and limited iron content, 
  whose effects are furthered by the high concentration of components that inhibit 
  iron absorption, normally present in special transitional foods and/or family 
  foods (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human milk, a source 
  of highly bioavailable iron, is offered to most children until the third or 
  fourth month of life. It is generally combined with cow's milk, which, in addition 
  do its low content of bioavailable iron, also promotes small-scale blood loss 
  by damaging the intestinal mucosa and causing the appearance of micro-hemorrhages 
  (ACC/SCN,<sup>1</sup> 1997). Thus, cow's milk may contribute towards the decline 
  of hemoglobin levels. Studies indicate that low levels of hemoglobin are also 
  associated with precarious living conditions and with inadequate sanitary conditions 
  in the area of residence (ACC/SCN,<sup>1</sup> 1997).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  was designed to evaluate the relationship between hemoglobin concentrations 
  and the consumption of breast milk, complementary foods, and other liquids during 
  the first twelve months of life.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This cross-sectional 
  study is part of a larger project, called "Breastfeeding, breastfeeding-termination 
  diets, and anemia during the first year of life in children attending the public 
  healthcare network."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample comprises 
  553 infants who attended public healthcare facilities in the city of Salvador, 
  Bahia, in northeastern Brazil, between July 1998 and August 1999. The sample 
  has a 90% power (1-<font face="Symbol">b</font>) to detect a 20% prevalence 
  of anemia with a 0.05 significance level (1-<font face="Symbol">a</font>). Children 
  were recruited by in three such facilities, during growth control and/or vaccination 
  visits. In case hemoglobin levels compatible with anemia were detected, the 
  mother and/or guardian were informed about nutritional therapy and, if necessary, 
  drug treatment was initiated. Mothers who agreed that their children participate 
  in the study signed a term of consent, as determined by Statute 196/1996 of 
  the National Health Council.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hemoglobin concentration 
  was determined in the field by the cyanmethaemoglobin method, using the HemoCue 
  system (WHO,<sup>19</sup> 2001), considered as reliable and recommended for 
  the determination of hemoglobin concentration during fieldwork.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In case hemoglobin 
  levels were below 9 g/dl of blood, a second dosage was performed and the mean 
  of the two measurements was adopted as the final value. Blood collection was 
  done by fingertip lancing, using disposable lancets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weight and length 
  were measured twice by properly trained nutrition students, under the supervision 
  of the research team. Microelectronic <i>Filizola</i> scales, model E-150/3P 
  were employed. Length was measured using a wooden infantometer, the reproducibility 
  of which has been tested in other studies by our group.<sup>5</sup> An error 
  of up to 100 g and 0.1 cm was tolerated in weight and length measurements, respectively 
  (WHO,<sup>16</sup> 1995). The mean of both measurements was used as final value. 
  Children were weighed without clothing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The instruments 
  used in anthropometrical evaluation were adjusted before each series of measurements 
  (OMS,<sup>12</sup> 1983). Data relative to weight and length at birth were obtained 
  from the child's birth certificate or child card. Weight-for-age and height-for-age 
  (in z-scores) were adopted for characterizing the child's anthropometric status.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on 
  the child's regular food consumption were obtained at the time of the interview 
  from the mother or guardian, based on a list of previously selected foods. Based 
  on this information, children were assigned to one of seven groups, according 
  to the feeding pattern adopted: 1) exclusive breastfeeding: children who were 
  fed exclusively breast milk – only medication and mineral or vitamin supplements 
  were allowed in this group; 2) predominant breastfeeding: children who were 
  given breast milk supplemented with tea and/or water; 3) complemented breastfeeding: 
  children who were given breast milk and other foods, excluding any other types 
  of milk; 4) mixed milk feeding: children who were given breast and cow's milk 
  and who did not consume any other type of food; 5) complemented mixed milk feeding: 
  children who consumed breast and cow's milk and other foods; 6) artificial milk 
  feeding: children who were fed exclusively cow's milk and did not consume any 
  other type of food; and 7) complemented artificial milk feeding: children who 
  were given exclusively cow's milk and not breast milk, complemented by other 
  foods. The number of formula-fed infants was too small for a separate analysis 
  to be conducted. Therefore artificial milk feeding included both formula and 
  cow's milk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mean values were 
  used to describe the distribution of hemoglobin levels according to the variables 
  of interest. The Dunnet test was used to evaluate the statistical significance 
  of the differences between means. Multiple linear regression was employed to 
  evaluate the association between hemoglobin levels and food consumption profile 
  and to explore the association between mean hemoglobin levels and the different 
  types of feeding patterns. The significance level adopted for keeping variables 
  in the model was 0.10. Associations with significance levels below 0.05 were 
  accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that 
  the food consumption of children under age six months differed, in both qualitative 
  and quantitative terms, from that of children aged 6 to 12 months, we chose 
  to analyze data separately for each of these groups. For children under age 
  6 months, exclusive breastfeeding was adopted as a protective factor; all consumption 
  of other foods was considered as undesirable due to the possibility of being 
  associated with anemia. For children 6 months or older, breast milk as the only 
  type of milk, associated with complementary foods, was adopted as the reference. 
  The consumption of any type of cow's milk was interpreted as a predisposing 
  condition for the development of anemia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A linear regression 
  model was adopted in order to evaluate the relationships of interest; thus, 
  hemoglobin level was included in the model as a continuous dependent value. 
  Sex, anthropometric indicators, (categorized as &lt;-2.0 and =-2.0 z-score standard 
  deviations (SD), child's age (continuous variable, squared when indicated), 
  duration of gestation (categorized as &lt;37 and =37 weeks), birthweight (categorized 
  as &lt;2,500 and =2,500 g), and maternal schooling (categorized as incomplete 
  elementary (1<sup>st</sup> – 8<sup>th</sup> grades) and complete elementary 
  or more – used in the present study as a proxy of the living conditions of children 
  and their families) were included in the model for adjustment. When appropriate, 
  categorized variables were transformed into their respective dummies. The main 
  independent variables relative to food consumption were categorized as yes/no 
  variables. Only those foods whose consumption frequencies were above 10% were 
  included in the regression model.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to avoid 
  the effects of colinearity in the statistical model, certain food items were 
  excluded from the analysis. Thus, for children under six months, meat was excluded 
  from the statistical model; for children older than six months, bean broth was 
  excluded, and beef broth and bean grains were included instead. This exclusion 
  was based on prior knowledge of the consumption patterns of infants in the city 
  of Salvador (Assis et al,<sup>5</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Multicolinearity 
  was evaluated by factor inflation variance (VIF) and tests of normality were 
  carried out using the Kolmogorov-Smirnof test; the homogeneity of variance was 
  evaluated by residual analysis (Armitage &amp; Berry,<sup>4</sup> 1997). Statistical 
  analysis was carried out using SPSS for Windows v. 10 software. Anthropometric 
  status evaluation was carried out using Anthro 1.02 software.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protocol of 
  the present study was submitted to and approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
  <i>Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas da Universidade Federal da Bahia</i>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mean hemoglobin 
  levels differed significantly according to age group (p&lt;0.001), sex (p=0.014), 
  anthropometric status expressed by weight-for-age (p=0.002), duration of gestation 
  (p=0.004), and birthweight (p&lt;0.001). The mean hemoglobin level among the 
  children studied was 10.65 g/dl (SD=1.989). Hemoglobin levels compatible with 
  anemia (&lt;11.0 g/dl) were detected in 62.8% of children, with greater occurrence 
  among children six months or older (72.6%) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent1.gif">Table 
  1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highest hemoglobin 
  concentrations were observed among exclusively breastfed children, followed 
  by those predominantly breastfed. The mean hemoglobin levels of children fed 
  according to the remaining patterns were significantly lower than those of exclusively 
  breastfed children (p&lt; 0.05). Even though the mean hemoglobin level estimated 
  for the predominant breastfeeding pattern was not compatible with anemia, it 
  was not significantly different from those of the other feeding patterns (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent2.gif">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the children 
  investigated, 97.6% had been breastfed at least once in their lifetimes. However, 
  before these children reached age six months, , this prevalence declined to 
  80.2%, and 32.2% of these children were already being given dried whole milk 
  or milk formula. Cow's milk in its natural form has little importance in infant 
  feeding patterns; the same pattern was observed with respect to modified formula 
  during the first six months of life (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent3.gif">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feeding mode before 
  age six months was based predominantly on breast milk, although tea, water, 
  starches, fruit, and dried whole –milk or milk -formula were already present. 
  After this age, major foods consumed were fruit, vegetables, dried whole milk, 
  cereals and derivatives (rice/pasta, bread, biscuits), starches, sugar, beef, 
  chicken, liver, and beans (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent3.gif">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  regression diagnostic procedures indicated the appropriateness of multiple linear 
  regression for exploring the associations of interest. All VIF values were below 
  3 and none were below 1, which indicates the absence of multicolinearity between 
  independent variables. The results of residual analysis indicated the appropriateness 
  of the exclusion of five cases whose hemoglobin levels were above 3 (four cases) 
  and below –3 (one case) standard deviations from the group mean for adjustment 
  purposes. In order to make variances homogeneous, age was introduced into some 
  analyses as a quadratic variable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Multiple linear 
  regression for the evaluation of the behavior of hemoglobin levels according 
  to the types of feeding patterns at the time of the interview was processed 
  only for children younger than six months. In this case, exclusive breastfeeding 
  was used as a reference (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent4.gif">Table 4</a>). The results, 
  after control for potential confounders, indicate that, during the first six 
  months of life, of the patterns analyzed, exclusive breastfeeding was the only 
  one to ensure higher levels of hemoglobin (<font face="Symbol">b</font>=11.98 
  g/dl; p&lt;0.001). All remaining feeding patterns reduced hemoglobin levels 
  in this age group. The predominant breastfeeding pattern was also associated 
  with a 0.73 g/dl reduction in mean hemoglobin levels (p=0.015), even though 
  these levels remained above the cutoff point for the characterization of anemia 
  (Hb=11.25 g/dl). It was also observed that when breastfeeding was maintained 
  in the child's diet but was complemented with other foods (complemented breastfeeding 
  pattern), hemoglobin levels fell 1.02 g/dl (p=0.009).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cow's milk and 
  breast milk combined (mixed milk feeding pattern) reduced hemoglobin levels 
  by 0.67 g/dl (p=0.44). Artificial milk feeding caused a 1.21 g/dl reduction 
  (p=0.009). The complemented mixed milk and complemented artificial milk patterns 
  caused reductions of 0.52 g/dl (p=0.152) and 0.55 g/dl (p=0.157) in hemoglobin 
  levels, respectively, but these reductions were not statistically significant 
  when exclusive breastfeeding was taken as a reference.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  the analysis of the importance of the consumption of selected foods to the determination 
  of hemoglobin levels in children under six months age are presented in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent5.gif">Table 
  5</a>. It was found that the consumption of tea/water reduces the hemoglobin 
  levels of these children by 0.76 g/dl (p&lt;0.001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the time of 
  the interview, only a small number of children aged 6 to 12 months (13.3% of 
  the children in this group) were fed according to the complemented breastfeeding 
  pattern. This limitation prevented an analysis of hemoglobin levels based on 
  the type of feeding pattern adopted, since, for this age group, the complemented 
  breastfeeding pattern should be taken as a reference. Thus only the multiple 
  linear regression analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the association 
  between hemoglobin levels and the consumption of selected foods. In this scenario, 
  mean hemoglobin levels were calculated at 11.47 g/dl (p&lt;0.001). With all 
  other variables maintained in the model, it was found that the consumption of 
  sugar and beans increased hemoglobin levels by 0.70 g/dl (p=0.017) and 0.56 
  g/dl (p=0.018), respectively. However, it was observed that fruit consumption 
  reduced these levels by 2 g/dl (p&lt;0.001)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was also found 
  that breast milk consumption by children in the 6 to 12 month age group increases 
  hemoglobin levels by 0.44 g/dl, although, in this case, no statistical significance 
  was found (p=0,07) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21084_ent5.gif">Table 5</a>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hemoglobin levels 
  compatible with anemia (&lt;11 g/dl) were found in 62.8% of children. Occurrence 
  was higher in the 6 to 12 month age group (72.6%), although the percentage detected 
  among children under six months was also high (58%). Our results indicate that 
  this disease constitutes an important health and nutrition problem among infants. 
  According to the World Health Organization, the most common cause of high prevalence 
  of anemia (above 40%) is the lack of dietary iron, which is related to the low 
  consumption of this micronutrient and/or to the high ingestion of inhibitors 
  of iron absorption (ACC/SCN,<sup>1</sup> 1997).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human breast milk 
  is acknowledged as the appropriate food for the child during the first months 
  of life, not only due to its energy, micro-, and macronutrient content, but 
  also because of the protection it confers against diseases (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 
  1998). Even though the amount of iron contained in human milk is not high, its 
  bioavailability is, and it is thus able to meet the child's needs during the 
  first six months of life (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 1998). From this age on, complementary 
  foods available in the family unit must be added to the child's diet in order 
  to increase the availability of energy and micronutrients, especially iron (WHO,<sup>17,18</sup> 
  1998; 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  statistical analysis, controlled for potential confounders, provide evidence 
  of the beneficial effect of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months 
  of life, since this pattern maintained the highest levels of hemoglobin (<font face="Symbol">b</font>=11.98 
  g/dl; p&lt;0.001). Our results are supported by those of other studies (Dewey 
  et al,<sup>8</sup> 1998; Wandel,<sup>14</sup> 1996).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was found that 
  feeding with cow's milk exclusively (artificial milk feeding) was the feeding 
  pattern associated with the greatest reduction in hemoglobin levels during the 
  first six months of life (<font face="Symbol">b</font>=-1.21; p=0.009). The 
  lowest mean hemoglobin level was observed in these conditions (Hb=10.77 g/dl). 
  Even when cow's milk is offered to the child together with breast milk (mixed 
  milk feeding), hemoglobin levels decreased by 0.67 g/dl (p=0.044). Dried whole 
  milk is the most consumed by the children investigated, regardless of age (49.2%). 
  The diets of 32.4% of children already included dried whole milk before the 
  sixth month of life. Due to the cross-sectional design of the present study, 
  it would not be prudent to attribute anemia to the consumption of cow's milk. 
  However, available information are consistent with respect to the deleterious 
  effect of this type of milk on iron levels, be it by favoring the formation 
  of intestinal micro-hemorrhages, be it by inhibiting iron absorption, especially 
  when associated with starches known to be rich in phytates, substances that 
  inhibit iron absorption by the intestine (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was also observed 
  that the predominant breastfeeding pattern reduced hemoglobin levels in children 
  under six months by 0.73 g/dl (p=0.015), even though the mean level in this 
  group remained above the cutoff point for characterization of anemia (Hb=11.25 
  g/dl).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less favorable 
  results were found for the complemented breastfeeding pattern, which reduced 
  hemoglobin levels by 1.02 g/dl (p=0.009) compared with the levels found in association 
  with exclusive maternal feeding, making them compatible with anemia (Hb=10.96 
  g/dl).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was also found 
  that, regardless of the pattern adopted, the apparently harmless consumption 
  of tea and/or water reduced mean hemoglobin levels in 0.76 g/dl (p&lt;0.001). 
  Thus, the exclusion of tea and water from the feeding patterns of children in 
  this age group is justified, not only due to the risk of contamination, disease 
  transmission, and abandonment of breastfeeding, but also due to their association 
  with the reduction of hemoglobin levels. It is possible that the consumption 
  of these items may favor on the child a sensation of gastric plenitude, thus 
  diminishing milk consumption and restricting the ingestion of the energy, micro- 
  and macronutrients necessary for hematopoiesis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of 
  the influence of complementary foods in the hemoglobin levels of children aged 
  6 to 12 months indicates that fruit consumption reduced these levels significantly 
  by 2 g/dl of blood. These results persisted even after control for potential 
  confounders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As with other consumption 
  patterns during infancy throughout a number of capitals in the country,<sup>9</sup> 
  in Salvador, the complementary feeding is begun with fruit, given at the 10 
  a.m. or 3 p.m. meals (Assis et al,<sup>5</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fruit consumption 
  was reported for 95.5% of all 6 to 12-month-old children investigated. This 
  percentage may be considered as satisfactory, although information on the amount 
  consumed is not available for these children. The results of a study involving 
  a representative sample of preschool children from the city of Salvador indicated 
  that children aged 6 to 12 months consume in average 160.8 g of fruit per day, 
  roughly half of the recommended daily amount. Fruit are given mashed or as fruit 
  juice. Juice usually has large quantities of added water, which implies a preparation 
  of low energetic density (Assis et al,<sup>5</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, we understand 
  that it would not be prudent to trace a direct relationship between fruit consumption 
  itself and the decline in hemoglobin levels. This relationship may be mediated 
  by forms of preparation marked by low energetic density and by the small amounts 
  of this item that are offered to children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 6 to 
  12-month-old children investigated, sugar consumption significantly increased 
  hemoglobin levels by 0.70 g/dl of blood. (p=0.017). The feeding patterns of 
  infants are characterized by the adoption of complementary foods of low energy 
  density and by the maternal restriction of the consumption of added fats (Assis 
  et al,<sup>5</sup> 2000). Hence, one may speculate that the statistical importance 
  found for the consumption of sugar in increasing hemoglobin levels in infants 
  reflects the physiological role played by this nutrient as a supplier of energy, 
  also needed for ensuring hematopoiesis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, the consumption 
  of beans significantly increased blood hemoglobin levels in children aged 6 
  to 12 months (<font face="Symbol">b</font>=0.56 g/dl, p=0.018). Although the 
  iron contained in beans is not highly bioavailable, daily and systematic consumption 
  may ensure adequate iron levels and contribute with a generous amount of energy. 
  Beans are given in the form of broth or grains, usually sifted. Of the 6 to 
  12-month-old children in the present study, 70.4% consumed bean broth and 50.1% 
  bean grains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although breast 
  milk consumption showed a trend towards decline as the child's age increased, 
  its consumption by children aged 6 to 12 months increased hemoglobin levels 
  by 0.44 g/dl (p=0.07). Even though this association was not statistically significant, 
  this result may be invested with biological and epidemiological significance, 
  and may indicate that the return to complemented breastfeeding may contribute 
  to revert the high prevalence of anemia (72.6%) found among children in this 
  age group. At the time of the interview, only 13.3% of children aged 6 to 12 
  months were following a complemented breastfeeding pattern. On the other hand, 
  57.5% of these children consumed breast milk but included cow's milk in their 
  diet (data not shown). Dried whole milk is usually associated with starches, 
  placed sixth among the foods most consumed by the children investigated. Starches 
  are rarely fortified with iron, and contain substantial amounts of phytates, 
  which impair iron absorption (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The early termination 
  of breastfeeding, the inclusion of dried whole milk in the feeding pattern, 
  and the inadequate choice of preparations, combined with the small amounts of 
  complementary foods given to the child, may partly explain the high prevalence 
  of hemoglobin levels compatible with anemia among the children investigated. 
  This conclusion is supported by consistent information on the ability of the 
  consumption of breast milk in association with complementary foods to meet the 
  child's iron need between ages 6 and 12 months (WHO,<sup>17</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also important 
  to emphasize the evidence for the role of a regulatory response in terms of 
  the absorption of breast-milk iron in children under complemented breastfeeding 
  diets, as indicated by Domell&ouml;f et al<sup>6</sup> (2002). These authors 
  observed that the rate of absorption of breast-milk iron among nine-month-old 
  children not supplemented with ferrous sulfate was significantly higher than 
  among those using supplementation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand, 
  therefore, that the strategy to be adopted in order to increase the hemoglobin 
  levels of children fed according to the complemented breastfeeding pattern resides 
  in the qualitatively and quantitatively adequate offering of complementary foods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Important among 
  the strategies of choice for fighting anemia in early life are the control of 
  events associated with pregnancy and lactation capable of interfering with the 
  child's hemoglobin levels. Thus, maternal anemia during gestation – a highly 
  prevalent event, even in developed countries (WHO,<sup>19</sup> 2001) – and 
  low birthweight (Dewey,<sup>8</sup> 1998) and/or preterm delivery (Allen,<sup>3</sup> 
  2000), prevent the accumulation of the fetal iron reserves necessary for the 
  first six months of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Especially among 
  the children included in the present study, low birthweight (<font face="Symbol">b</font>=-0.87g/dl; 
  p=0.04) showed a significant negative association with hemoglobin levels in 
  children under age six months. Preterm delivery was associated with a 0.71 decrease 
  in hemoglobin levels, but this association was not significant (p=0.06) (data 
  not shown in tables).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this range 
  of action, it is important also to control the hemoglobin levels of the lactating 
  mother during the process of lactation. Even though there is no evidence that 
  the iron content in breast milk is a reflection of maternal iron levels (Domell&ouml;f 
  et al,<sup>8</sup> 2004), it is a consensus that if lactation is continued after 
  the protective effect of lactational amenorrhea on maternal iron reserves ends, 
  there is an increase in maternal iron requirements. Under these circumstances, 
  it is likely that the iron content in milk is not enough to provide adequate 
  amounts of this mineral to the child (Viteri,<sup>15</sup> 1994). Thus, these 
  conditions may be of epidemiological importance to mothers and their children, 
  and must be considered whenever anemia occurs within the first six months of 
  life, especially among children with high breast milk consumption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the statistical 
  results of the present study have been adjusted for most biological factors 
  likely to interfere with blood hemoglobin levels, adjustment for socioeconomic 
  variables may be considered as limited, given that maternal schooling alone 
  was used as a proxy of socioeconomic conditions. We also acknowledge that, even 
  after the issue of model adjustment is overcome, the design of the present study 
  does not allow us to attribute the anemia found in the children investigated 
  to the early termination of breastfeeding and the consumption of complementary 
  foods and non-nutritive liquids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, the 
  present results indicate that the total or partial replacement of breast milk 
  with other foods before age six months is associated with reductions in hemoglobin 
  levels. Our results also encourage a reflection about the form of preparation 
  of the complementary foods given to infants, given that the lowest levels of 
  hemoglobin were observed when complementary foods were included in the infant's 
  diet. Thus, prolonging exclusive breastfeeding until age six months and maintaining 
  breastfeeding after this age, combined with the consumption of complementary 
  foods with adequate timing and at appropriate quantities, are strategies that 
  may contribute towards increasing hemoglobin levels during the first year of 
  life.</font></p>
