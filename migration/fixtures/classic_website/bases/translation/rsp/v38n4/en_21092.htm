<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Epidemiological 
  studies suggest a relationship between suntanning habits and high risk of melanoma. 
  A literature review was carried out for the period between 1977 and 1998 using 
  Medline and Embase (Excerpta Medica) databases. The analysis showed that intentional 
  sun exposure is highly prevalent among youths, despite their awareness of the 
  risks involved in excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation and their knowledge 
  on skin protection measures. Intentional exposure is a habit fostered by certain 
  beliefs and attitudes towards suntanning and stimulated by peer pressure and 
  aesthetic referents. The most common tanning practices involve a high risk of 
  developing melanoma. It was concluded that the most effective means to prevent 
  melanoma is mass media dissemination of the concept that having a tanned skin 
  is not healthy – since it implies the skin being damaged by solar ultraviolet 
  radiation – and education campaigns for effectively changing people's behaviors 
  and their motivations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last forty 
  years, the incidence of cutaneous melanoma has shown an increasing trend worldwide.<sup>18,19,24</sup> 
  In countries such as the United States<sup>54,55</sup> and Australia,<sup>19,41</sup> 
  in spite of this increasing trend, the mortality associated to the disease has 
  plateaued or declined. In Brazil, on the other hand, melanoma mortality is still 
  on the rise.<sup>87,98</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solar ultraviolet 
  (UV) radiation is well known as a complete human carcinogen.<sup>53</sup> Of 
  the skin cancers associated with exposure to this type of radiation, the cutaneous 
  melanoma is the severest, due to its high lethality. Although there have been 
  important advances in treatment, this disease is still responsible for a substantial 
  number of deaths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Epidemiological 
  studies show a strong association between the development of melanoma and the 
  frequency of episodes of severe skin burns caused by UV radiation.<sup>38,46,95</sup> 
  The activity most closely related to the occurrence of this type of skin burn 
  is sunbathing, a resource employed for skin tanning.<sup>69</sup> Anatomical 
  areas exposed to the highest doses of UV radiation are also the areas most commonly 
  burnt,<sup>32,41,48</sup> and for which the fastest growing time trends in terms 
  of the development of melanoma can be observed.<sup>16,34,44</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  the exposure to solar radiation, the exposure to artificial sources of UV has 
  also increased. The practice of artificial tanning is spreading rapidly and 
  is now within reach for a considerable proportion of the population. It is argued 
  that artificial tanning is a secure option, since the lamps employed emit only 
  UVA (ultraviolet A), the longer-wavelength ultraviolet radiation. However, recent 
  studies indicate that UVA is important in the generation of melanoma, acting 
  synergically with UVB (ultraviolet B).<sup>67</sup> Another practice which results 
  in increased exposure to UV radiation is the use of sunscreen.<sup>6,93</sup> 
  Recent studies provide evidence for the so-called 'sunscreen paradox', i.e., 
  people who use sunscreen the most are those who suffer burns more often.<sup>68</sup> 
  Some authors found a positive association between the frequent use of sunscreen 
  and the development of melanoma.<sup>7,97</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The behavioral 
  changes that have led to increases in both natural and artificial exposure to 
  UV radiation were, to a great extent, encouraged by the aesthetic valorization 
  of tanned skin. Such valorization resulted in the widespread dissemination of 
  outdoor activities and in the use of clothing that exposed greater areas of 
  the body. An immediate consequence of the adoption of such practices is that 
  more people are exposed more frequently to UV radiation, one of the major etiological 
  agents of melanoma.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Articles published 
  in the 1977-1998 period were identified through digital search in the Medline 
  database. A manual search was also carried out in the Excerpta Medica manual, 
  in order to identify studies published in the same period. The main keywords 
  used in the search were 'suntanning', 'sunbathing', 'sun exposure', 'sun protection', 
  'sunscreen', 'sun related behavior', 'sun awareness', 'sunburn', 'sunburning', 
  'health behaviour', 'skin cancer prevention', 'tanning lamps', 'sunlamp', 'sunbed', 
  'indoor tanning', 'tanning bed', 'tanning salon', 'ultraviolet exposure', 'ultraviolet 
  radiation', 'solar radiation', 'ultraviolet dosimetry', 'artificial ultraviolet 
  exposure', 'photoprotection', 'photocarcinogenesis', 'malignant melanoma', 'cutaneous 
  melanoma', 'melanoma epidemiology', 'polymorphism', 'DNA photodamage', 'DNA 
  repair capacity', 'oncogene', and 'Case-Control Studies'. The more recent publications 
  on the subject (from 2000 onwards) were used as sources for other references 
  and for important journals dealing with cancer, dermatology, and epidemiology. 
  Of the articles thus obtained, the most pertinent to the present review were 
  selected based on the quality of the experimental and epidemiological studies 
  on which they were based.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present review 
  is aimed at establishing relationships between experimental studies of carcinogenicity 
  and UV radiation, epidemiological studies of the risk of melanoma among artificial 
  tanning and sunscreen users, and psychosocial studies of habits and behaviors 
  related to solar exposure and tanning. Furthermore, we intend to discuss possible 
  relationships between the results of epidemiological and psychosocial studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE CARCINOGENICITY 
  OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The spectrum of 
  UV radiation is divided into three bands of wavelengths, designated UVA, UVB 
  and UVC (ultraviolet C). The first spectral band, corresponding to the longer 
  wavelengths (315 nm to 400 nm), in spite of its lower efficiency in producing 
  erythema and subsequent melanogenesis, is capable of inducing oxidative processes.<sup>97,100</sup> 
  When absorbed, UVA reacts with molecular oxygen, producing reactive species 
  capable of inducing inflammatory reactions on the skin and DNA damage.<sup>75</sup> 
  Since UVB-like cutaneous effects are not distributed uniformly across the UVA 
  spectrum, this band was subdivided into UVA-1 (340-400 nm) and UVA-2 (315-340 
  nm), the latter being more erythemogenic. The second band comprises the intermediate 
  wavelengths (312-280 nm), more efficient in producing direct DNA damage, photo-immunosuppression, 
  erythema, thickening of the stratum corneum, and melanogenesis.<sup>97,100</sup> 
  The final band, comprising the shorter wavelengths (280-100 nm) includes the 
  wavelength of maximal absorption by pure DNA, which is 260 nm.<sup>97,100</sup> 
  However, due to its low penetration in the epidermis, it is not as effective 
  as UVA and UVB in stimulating melanin synthesis.<sup>75</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two mechanisms 
  by which UV radiation may damage DNA are the direct excitation of DNA molecules, 
  which is predominant during exposure to the UVB region, and the generation of 
  highly-reactive oxygen species, which predominates during exposure to the UVA 
  region.<sup>83,91</sup> Oxidative damage may be mediated by melanin. Cells previously 
  irradiated, first with low and then with high doses of UVA, showed twice the 
  amount of oxidative damage when compared to cells lacking the first irradiation.<sup>62</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DNA damage, especially 
  direct damage, is promptly repaired by the nucleotide excision/repair system. 
  Low DNA-repair capacity increases the risk of developing melanoma.<sup>63</sup> 
  The presence of certain variants of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) also 
  increases this risk.<sup>60</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The confirmation 
  of the mutagenicity of UV radiation occurred in 1960, with the discovery of 
  the formation of cyclobutane photodimers after irradiation of thymine with 254 
  nm waves.<sup>29</sup> Subsequent studies identified that which would be the 
  hallmark of UV radiation: the production of point mutations in DNA (at sites 
  containing two adjacent pyrimidines), leading to the formation of cyclobuthyl 
  pyrimidine dimers and of pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts.<sup>29,64</sup> 
  The production of photodimers on the human skin, more specifically in keratinocytes 
  and melanocytes,<sup>99</sup> can be induced by both UVA and UVB.<sup>39,99</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the loci 
  in which UV-induced mutations have been found is the p53 gene. The most important 
  functions of this gene are stopping the cell cycle at the G1 stage for the reparation 
  of damaged DNA and, when damage is extensive, the induction of apoptosis (programmed 
  cell death).<sup>46,64</sup> Immunohistochemistry assays detected increased 
  expression of mutant p53 in pre-cancerous lesions,<sup>70</sup> benign cutaneous 
  tumors,<sup>1,47,70,79</sup> and non-malenocytic skin cancers.<sup>47,70</sup> 
  These findings indicate that mutations in the p53 gene would be an early event 
  in the carcinogenesis of cutaneous tumors. In the specific case of melanoma, 
  the results of immunohistochemistry assays vary substantially, from the detection 
  of increased expression of the protein codified by the p53 gene in virtually 
  all samples<sup>1</sup> to a minimal proportion of positive outcomes in the 
  specimens examined.<sup>79</sup> Such variability indicated that other genes, 
  such as proto-oncogene N-<i>ras</i>, and tumor suppressing gene CDKN2A, may 
  also be targets of UV-induced mutations.<sup>57</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first documented 
  study of the induction of cutaneous tumors in animal models by UV irradiation 
  was developed by Findlay,<sup>11</sup> in 1928. In the following decades, researchers 
  determined the spectrum for cutaneous carcinogenesis in animals, whose upper 
  limit was 320 nm.<sup>12</sup> More recent studies succeeded at inducing pre-cancerous 
  melanocytic lesions and cutaneous melanoma by irradiating the skin of laboratory 
  opossums (<i>Monodelphis</i> domestica)<sup>65,66</sup> and human skin grafted 
  onto murine models.<sup>3</sup> The spectrum for the induction of melanoma was 
  determined by Setlow et al<sup>84</sup> (1993), using the hybrid fish <i>Xiphororus</i> 
  as a model. In the UVB region, the curve was similar to that found for direct 
  DNA damage. Efficiency slowly declines in the UVA region, but levels of induction 
  remain high, suggesting the action of indirect mechanisms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE EPIDEMIOLOGY 
  OF CUTANEOUS MELANOMA</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanocytes are 
  dendritic cells which originate in the neural crest and migrate to the epidermis 
  during embryogenesis. The main function of these cells is the synthesis and 
  transfer of melanin granules to neighboring keratinocytes.<sup>85</sup> Skin 
  color is partly determined by the type of melanin granules synthesized by melanocytes, 
  which may contain eumelanin (black or brown pigment), pheomelanin (yellow or 
  red pigment), or a mixture of both.<sup>56</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amount of melanocytes 
  in the epidermis varies according to the anatomical area, the head and forearm 
  being the regions with the highest density of such cells.<sup>56</sup> External 
  stimuli, such as UV radiation, can induce melanocyte proliferation. In individuals 
  exposed to solar radiation, an increase in melanin density can be observed in 
  the anatomical areas of greatest exposure.<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proliferative changes 
  in the melanocytic system are classified, from least to most aggressive, as: 
  benign melanocytic nevus, dysplastic nevus, radial growth melanoma, vertical 
  growth melanoma, and metastatic melanoma.<sup>85</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both the benign 
  melanocytic and the dysplastic nevi are considered as markers of melanoma, and 
  their presence increases the risk of developing the disease.<sup>9,22,36,81,95</sup> 
  The dysplastic nevus is considered as a precursor lesion of melanoma.<sup>15</sup> 
  Indeed, clinical studies which followed the development of cutaneous lesions 
  have been able to observe the evolution of dysplastic nevi into melanoma.<sup>86</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanoma corresponds 
  to the final stage of melanocytic carcinogenesis, in which the genetic instability 
  of initiated cells leads to an increase in their proliferative and invasive 
  abilities.<sup>15</sup> During the evolution of the disease, these cells show 
  increasing aggressiveness, progressing through the stages of radial and vertical 
  growth and into the metastatic stage.<sup>33</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cutaneous melanoma 
  is classified into four clinical-histological groups: <i>lentigo maligna melanoma,</i> 
  <i>superficial spreading melanoma</i>, <i>nodular melanoma</i>, and <i>acrolentiginous</i> 
  <i>melanoma</i>. The first subtype accounts for 5% of melanomas in Caucasians, 
  and is more frequently diagnosed in women, subjects older than 60 years, and 
  in anatomical areas more intensely exposed to the sun.<sup>34,89</sup> The most 
  common subtype among light-skinned individuals is the <i>superficial spreading 
  melanoma</i>, which accounts for 70% of all diagnosed melanomas. The predominant 
  anatomical area varies according to age: the disease occurs in areas less exposed 
  to the sun (back, arms, shoulders, legs and thighs) in younger individuals, 
  and in more exposed areas (head, neck) in older individuals.<sup>34,89</sup> 
  The <i>nodular</i> subtype is the second most common amongst Caucasians, accounting 
  for 10-12% of all diagnosed melanomas.<sup>85</sup> As with the <i>superficial 
  spreading melanoma,</i> its anatomical distribution varies with age. <sup>34,89</sup> 
  The rarest subtype is the <i>acrolentiginous melanoma</i>.<sup>85</sup> This 
  subtype is commonest among individuals of African descent, and predominant anatomical 
  areas are palms, soles, and nailbeds.<sup>26,34,89</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prognosis is best 
  for the <i>lentigo maligna</i> and <i>superficial spreading</i> subtypes.<sup>8,85</sup> 
  The worst prognosis is associated with age above 60 years,<sup>8,85</sup> male 
  gender,<sup>8,67,85</sup> lesions located on the trunk,<sup>8</sup> thicker 
  tumors,<sup>8,85</sup> and lower socioeconomic level.<sup>67</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most important 
  risk factors for the development of melanoma include: level of skin pigmentation, 
  presence of multiple nevi, propensity towards the development of ephelides, 
  history of severe sunburns, and skin reactions upon exposure to the sun.<sup>4,20,27,36,82,94,95</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other important 
  factors are higher education,<sup>43,94</sup> high socioeconomic status,<sup>61,76</sup> 
  non-manual occupations,<sup>37</sup> work in offices, <sup>10,73,88</sup> and 
  outdoor recreation.<sup>35,52,73</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population based 
  studies conducted in Denmark,<sup>74</sup> the United States, <sup>33</sup> 
  and Sweden<sup>58</sup> found the predominant anatomical areas to be the trunk 
  (men) and lower limbs (women). However, when analyzing temporal trends with 
  respect to predominant anatomical areas, a similar pattern is observed for both 
  sexes: an increase in the incidence of melanoma on the upper limbs and trunk.<sup>16,18,24,44</sup> 
  Apparently, these changes in the pattern of anatomical distribution of lesions 
  may have been influenced by environmental factors, given that areas more continuously 
  exposed predominate in older cohorts, whereas areas intermittently exposed predominate 
  in younger cohorts.<sup>18,23,33,34</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pattern observed 
  in terms of the incidence of melanoma by anatomical area seems to be compatible 
  with the amount of radiation to which a given area is exposed during outdoor 
  recreational activities. Some of these areas, such as the back and shoulders, 
  are the areas that are exposed to the greatest doses of UV radiation during 
  open air activities.<sup>31,40,48</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The anatomical 
  variation of melanoma incidence, in both younger and older subjects, seems to 
  follow the changes in the distribution of sunburns according to age and sex. 
  Melia &amp; Bulman<sup>71</sup> (1995) observed that, among younger subjects 
  (ages 16-24 years), 66% of sunburns occurred on the back and shoulders and 36% 
  on the head and neck area. Among older subjects, sunburns on the head and neck 
  were more frequent (59%), followed by those on the back and shoulders (18%). 
  No preferential area was observed among younger women. However, among older 
  women, areas most frequently burnt were the head and neck (63%), followed by 
  the upper limbs (46%). These authors also observed that sunburns, especially 
  more severe ones, were more tolerated among younger subjects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ARTIFICIAL 
  TANNING AND CUTANEOUS MELANOMA</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of UV-emitting 
  devices for tanning purposes has been expanding quickly in the last few years, 
  especially in industrialized countries.<sup>38,77</sup> In the United States, 
  the first commercial installation dates back to 1978. In 1988 there were already 
  over 18,000 tanning centers, with an estimated turnout of two million individuals 
  per day.<sup>77</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first devices 
  employed UVB-emitting fluorescent lamps. However, the serious risk of erythema 
  and ocular damage associated with this type of radiation led to the substitution 
  of this lamp with other models. Although more recent models emit predominantly 
  UVA, small amounts of UVB are still present.<sup>30</sup> A quantitative study 
  of the levels of UVA and UVB emitted by commonly used devices indicated that 
  UVB irradiance ranges between 0.21 and 2.5 times that of solar radiation. In 
  the UVA spectrum, irradiance is two to 13 times greater than that of the sun.<sup>72</sup> 
  Another study found an irradiance in the UVA1 range 1.3 times greater than, 
  and in the UVA2 region practically equal to, that of the midday sun in the Mediterranean 
  region.<sup>69</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Positive associations 
  between the development of melanoma and the use of artificial tanning devices 
  have been found in studies conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe.<sup>5,23,90,92</sup> 
  Major risk factors are annual frequency of artificial tanning sessions, and 
  duration of this practice in years. Apparently, beginning artificial tanning 
  before age 30 results in a greater increase in risk. These studies suggest that 
  the risk of developing melanoma is greater among frequent users who begin earlier 
  in life.<sup>23,90</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SUNSCREEN 
  AND MELANOMA</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An event frequently 
  observed by researchers among individuals who expose themselves to the sun is 
  the 'sunscreen paradox': users of sunscreens with higher sun protection factor 
  (SPF) values were more likely to suffer sunburns. Autier et al (1999),<sup>6</sup> 
  in a double-blind randomized study, provided subjects with SPF 10 and SPF 30 
  sunscreen. Sunscreen use was associated with greater frequency and duration 
  of sunbathing, both of which were more critical among subjects given SPF 30 
  sunscreen (25% higher than the other group). Of the participating subjects, 
  45% reported at least one episode of sunburn, and 85% reported the occurrence 
  of mild erythema.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McCarthy et al<sup>68</sup> 
  (1999) also verified that, among sunbathers, those which wore sunscreen with 
  higher SPF values had a greater frequency of sunburns when compared to those 
  wearing lower SPFs or not wearing sunscreen at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a study of sunscreen 
  use among children, Autier et al<sup>7</sup> (1999) found increased numbers 
  of nevi related to increased exposure to the sun and to use of sunscreen. For 
  the highest levels of exposure, nevus counts of children who always or almost 
  always wore sunscreen were twice those of children who never wore sunscreen.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PSYCHOSOCIAL 
  STUDIES OF THE BELIEFS, MOTIVATIONS, AND RISK PERCEPTIONS ASSOCIATED TO SUNTANNING</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Nineteenth 
  Century, the dominant aesthetic standards favored light skin, since it was an 
  indicator of higher socioeconomic status.<sup>2</sup> Due to the involvement 
  in agricultural activities and other types of physical work, a large share of 
  the population was constantly exposed to the sun and, consequently, had tanned 
  skin. Thus, maintaining a tan was associated with poverty. After the Industrial 
  Revolution, in 1837, more people from the less favored socioeconomic strata 
  started to work indoors, away from the sun, and thus light skin ceased to be 
  such a marked indicator of social status.<sup>2,59</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As late as the 
  first two decades of the Twentieth Century, tanned skin was still associated 
  with inferior social conditions, and richer individuals struggled to keep their 
  skin light. This effort included avoiding regular exposure to the sun and protecting 
  themselves with hats, umbrellas, and more protective clothing. After the 1920's, 
  this stereotype was reversed, with the adoption, in centers of great influence 
  in the field of fashion, such as France, of tanned skin as the desirable aesthetic 
  standard.<sup>77</sup> Tanned skin thus became a sign of wealth, an indicator 
  of enough free time and financial resources to dedicate oneself to leisure and 
  to attending summer vacation sites.<sup>2,59</sup> Since suntanning was no longer 
  undesirable, there was a greater level of engagement in outdoor recreational 
  activities. Sunbathing grew more frequent and clothing became smaller, exposing 
  greater areas of the body to the sun.<sup>2,77</sup> Two major forces behind 
  these changes in behavior were the diffusion of the fashionable status of suntan 
  in 1929 and the introduction of two-piece swimsuits in 1946.<sup>77</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, this 
  change took place during the early 1920's, along with the spread of sports and 
  open air recreational activities.<sup>42</sup> In the 1930's, tanned skin became 
  a new aesthetic standard, and there was an increase in the frequency of bathing 
  in the sea and swimming pools and the development of the first tanning oils.<sup>42</sup> 
  During this decade, changes in clothing began to expose areas of the body previously 
  covered, such as legs, arms, chest, and back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  of tanned skin with health was partly triggered by the advent of heliotherapy 
  in Europe, still in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. This therapeutic 
  practice recommended daily sunbathing as a preventive – or even curative – measure 
  for certain diseases, such as tuberculosis and some cutaneous affections.<sup>2,59</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population-wide 
  behaviors regarding tanning are partly nourished by three beliefs: that tanned 
  skin makes people more attractive, that tanning is beneficial to health, and 
  that prior tanning prevents the undesirable effects of future exposure to the 
  sun.<sup>49,80</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boldeman et al<sup>13</sup> 
  (1997) reported more frequent use of tanning beds among subjects who considered 
  themselves as less attractive (RR=1.57 95%CI=1.15-2.15), and that the main motivations 
  behind this use were to obtain a tanned complexion (98%) and to relax / obtain 
  good appearance (84%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a population-based 
  study conducted in Canada, artificial tanning users reported the following main 
  reasons for using artificial tanning: improving appearance (56.7%), acquiring 
  of a protective tan (27.6%), relaxing (11.8%), and obtaining a healthy aspect 
  (10.8%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a survey conducted 
  by Robinson et al<sup>80</sup> (1997), 68% of subjects answered that "people 
  have better appearance with tanned skin". This belief was predominant among 
  white male subjects. The healthy appearance created by tanning was appreciated 
  by the majority of subjects of higher purchasing power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The maintenance 
  of this type of behavior is influenced by how the person feels and by the qualities 
  he or she appreciates. Such behavior is reinforced by the attitude and opinions 
  of the group with which this person interacts or identifies.<sup>49,59,96</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United States, 
  Hillhouse et al<sup>49</sup> (1997) found the following predictive factors for 
  intentional exposure to risk (sunbathing, artificial tanning) or for protection 
  (use of sunscreen): the subject's own feeling about sunbathing, the desire to 
  be in accord with aesthetic referents, and the perception of being able to control 
  the behavior. In another analysis, Hillhouse et al<sup>50</sup> (1996) found 
  that sunbathing was predicted by perceptions of sunbathing as relaxing, while 
  sun lamp use was predicted by more positive views of suntans. Group influence 
  on individual tanning-related behavior was investigated by Keesling &amp; Friedman<sup>59</sup> 
  (1987). According to these authors, such behavior is influenced by the feeling 
  of relaxation, concerns about appearance, high percentage of peers who sunbathe, 
  positive comments regarding the subject's own suntan, and membership in sports 
  clubs. In addition, for this population, to be tan is related to maintaining 
  a self-image of activity, health, and attractiveness. A similar study conducted 
  by Wichstrom<sup>96</sup> (1994) found that, among male adolescents, the engagement 
  of peers in sunbathing predicts the subject's own engagement, showing susceptibility 
  to group influence. Concerning self-image, Castle et al<sup>22</sup> (1999) 
  observed that young women who sought suntanning described themselves as less 
  complex, philosophical, imaginative, and intellectual, and tended to appreciate 
  these qualities in other people to a lesser extent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When sunbathing, 
  undergoing artificial tanning, or seeking protection with sunscreen, the individual 
  is evaluating the risks involved in the behaviors adopted in relation to the 
  benefits achieved.<sup>49</sup> In this evaluation, one tends to give more weight 
  to short-term benefits than to long-term ones. A characteristic trait of individuals 
  that habitually seek tanning is their propensity to adopt risk behaviors, which, 
  in their eyes, are associated with an 'active' personality.<sup>59</sup> Hence, 
  younger people are those who sunbathe or use sun beds the most,<sup>71,78,80</sup> 
  and men suffer more burns than women.<sup>68,71</sup> And, despite having suffered 
  adverse reactions, such people are willing to submit to further exposure.<sup>14,78</sup> 
  Such individuals, when exposing themselves to the sun, do so for prolonged periods 
  and during the hours in which the risk of erythema is highest ( from 10 a.m. 
  to 4 p.m.).<sup>6,14,49,68,80</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Risk behavior was 
  evaluated by Keesling &amp; Friedman<sup>59</sup> (1987), in a study conducted 
  among beachgoers. These authors observed that exposure to the sun was associated 
  with deriving high personal rewards from risk taking. According to the authors, 
  frequent sunbathers would be persons used to taking risks, and who would not 
  change their behavior even after alerted about the risk of developing skin cancer. 
  Castle et al<sup>22</sup> (1999) observed that, in the 16-19 years age group, 
  the perceived benefits of tanning had greater weight than the costs related 
  to such behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rhainds et al<sup>78</sup> 
  (1999), in a population-based study conducted in Canada, found that the majority 
  of artificial tanning adepts were youngsters, who, even after experiencing adverse 
  reactions, did not intend to abandon the habit. In Scotland, when analyzing 
  the profiles of costumers of artificial tanning centers, McGinley et al<sup>69</sup> 
  (1998) found that most of these costumers were youngsters. In this study, skin 
  phototypes I and II accounted for 38% of subjects, and a similar proportion 
  reported adverse reactions after using sun beds. The most common usage pattern 
  included 50 yearly sessions (31%), although a significant proportion of users 
  (16%) had more than 100 sessions per year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Risk behavior can 
  be observed even among individuals at high risk of developing melanoma. Brandberg 
  et al<sup>14</sup> (1996) followed the behavior of subjects with phenotypes 
  indicative of dysplastic nevus syndrome for a 30-day period and found that 84% 
  of these subjects practiced sunbathing for tanning purposes; of these, 61% suffered 
  at least one episode of sunburn. Subjects who suffered from sunburns reported 
  more frequent sunbathing and longer periods of exposure to the sun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another characteristic 
  of tanning seekers is poor perception of the risk involved. In the study by 
  Douglass et al<sup>32</sup> (1997), only 26% of phototype I subjects considered 
  themselves at high risk of developing skin cancer. Hillhouse et al<sup>50</sup> 
  (1996), in a study conducted among university students, found that 50.8% of 
  subjects reported their own phototypes as darker than those determined by the 
  researchers. An optimistic bias was also detected by Clarke et al<sup>25</sup> 
  (1997). These authors found that subjects, when evaluating their own risk, saw 
  themselves as having a lower risk of developing skin cancer, of developing it 
  at a younger age, and of loosing years of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though women 
  expose themselves more to the sun, they also protect themselves better, have 
  a better perception of risk, and are more likely to change behaviors when compared 
  to men. Douglass et al<sup>32</sup> (1997) found that, although women reported 
  severe skin burns more often than men, 67% of women had had less burns at the 
  time of the study than at age 15 years. Among men, no change was observed in 
  the frequency of burns. The low perception of their own risk and the lesser 
  likelihood to change behavior would explain the greater frequency of burns among 
  men. When studying a sample of beachgoers, McCarthy et al<sup>68</sup> (1999) 
  found that 75% of men and 43% of women were sunburnt upon leaving the beach.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difference 
  in risk perception observed between genders does not occur between different 
  social strata. Successive exposure is reported to an equal extent by subjects 
  of greater and lesser purchasing power, with variations only in terms of the 
  circumstances of this exposure. Individuals of higher socioeconomic status and 
  with higher educational level are more likely to burn themselves during leisure 
  activities, whereas those from lower strata tend to do so during labor-related 
  activities. Melia &amp; Bulman<sup>71</sup> (1995) found that, among non-manual 
  workers, 14% of sunburns were related to sports, whereas among manual workers, 
  only 8% of burns were related to such activities. Robinson et al<sup>80</sup> 
  (1997) found that prolonged exposure to the sun during weekends was associated 
  with higher income and indoor labor, and that prolonged exposure during weekdays 
  was associated with lesser schooling and outdoor labor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL 
  CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adolescence is 
  marked by low perception of risk, strong peer influence, excessive concern with 
  appearance, and greater tolerance of severe sunburns. These factors, combined 
  with the strong appeal of the suntan aesthetics still in vogue, lead to the 
  adoption of behaviors that result in excessive solar exposure. This exposure 
  is due not only to the desire to acquire a tan, but also to a lack of concern 
  with skin protection during daily activities. Episodes of severe sunburn, combined 
  with excessive exposure to the sun during childhood and adolescence, are associated 
  with a high risk of developing cutaneous melanoma. Holly et al<sup>51</sup> 
  (1995) found a high risk of developing melanoma in association with frequent 
  episodes of severe sunburn before age 30 years (OR=2.1 (95%CI=1.4-3.1) during 
  childhood, OR=2.7; (95%CI=1.8-4.1) during adolescence, OR=2.7 (95%CI=1.6-4.6) 
  from 18 to 22 years, and OR=2.7 (95%CI=1.5-4.8) from 23 to 30 years).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Substituting artificial 
  tanning for suntanning in order to obtain or maintain a "healthier", "more attractive" 
  complexion is related to an increase in risk, since it leads to increased exposure 
  to UV radiation and to the exposure of individuals with higher risk phototypes. 
  Studies show that the risk of developing melanoma is greater for habitual users, 
  users that begin at an earlier age, and who practice artificial tanning for 
  longer periods. Autier et al<sup>5</sup> found a 1.77-fold risk for frequent 
  users when compared to subjects who never used artificial tanning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although some case-control 
  studies suggest that frequent use of sunscreen reduces the risk of developing 
  melanoma,<sup>28</sup> other cross-sectional<sup>71,73</sup> and experimental<sup>6,7</sup> 
  studies indicate that sunscreen users have a greater incidence of erythema, 
  especially of the severe type. This apparent inconsistency between different 
  types of study may indicate a different pattern of sun exposure between sunscreen 
  users nowadays and in former times. In the past, when the use of tanning oils 
  was encouraged, it is possible that individuals who wore sunscreen also adopted 
  other protective behaviors. Currently, the use of sunscreen is associated with 
  the possibility of remaining under the sun for longer periods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaigns centered 
  on the divulgation of risks and on encouraging people to protect themselves 
  and to avoid exposure to the sun during peak hours apparently increase knowledge 
  among youngsters; they do not, however, promote any changes in behavior. In 
  the study conducted by Hillhouse et al<sup>49</sup> (1997), most youngsters 
  practiced sunbathing, despite the high level of knowledge of risk and forms 
  of protection detected among these subjects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those responsible 
  for forming the opinions of youngsters and for divulging behavior patterns among 
  this public, when overrating tanned skin and presenting sunbathing – be it on 
  the beach or swimming pool – as something pleasurable, no matter the time of 
  the day or the total period of exposure, stimulate exposure to the sun and discourage 
  practices aimed at protecting the skin from the sun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Australia, one 
  of the countries with highest incidence of cutaneous melanoma, there has been 
  a reduction in the exposure of individuals to the sun. However, this reduction 
  is the result of many years of campaigns and effective actions aimed at increasing 
  protection against the sun. In schools, recreation areas are covered by trees 
  or buildings and the use of clothing and hats is encouraged. In fashion magazines, 
  there is a greater frequency of models with natural skin color.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same way 
  as there are campaigns aimed at discouraging smoking, due to the health hazards 
  related to this behavior, there should also be similar campaigns addressing 
  excessive exposure to the sun. Divulgation of the concept that tanned skin is 
  not healthy – since it is skin that has been damaged by solar ultraviolet radiation 
  – and the implementation of campaigns capable of effectively modifying people's 
  behaviors and the motivations behind them, may yield profits for the generations 
  to come.</font></p>
