<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In assessing food 
  intake patterns in groups of individuals, it is usually important to know how 
  many of these individuals present nutrient intakes above or below a determined 
  criterion. This information is relevant for planning healthcare actions, both 
  in monitoring and in assessing such interventions, and also for the purposes 
  of regulating commercial activities. This paper discusses a new methodology 
  for estimating the prevalence of inadequate nutrient intake, with the Dietary 
  Reference Intakes as the reference values. The utilization of diet surveys that 
  allow the most accurate quantitative estimate possible is dealt with. These 
  should use repeated measurements of food intake, on non-consecutive days. The 
  food intake should be adjusted for between-person and within-person variance, 
  so as to obtain a corrected distribution for the nutrient intake values. After 
  constructing this distribution curve based on the corrected estimated parameters 
  (average and standard deviation), the EAR method (Estimated Average Requirement) 
  can be used as a cutoff point for verifying the proportion of individuals that 
  has inadequate nutrient intake. This corresponds to the area of the curve below 
  this reference value. It is concluded that this new approach minimizes the error 
  in the calculation of the prevalence of inadequate nutrient intake, since it 
  takes into consideration the random characteristics of the diet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of 
  this work was to discuss a methodology for estimating the prevalence of inadequate 
  nutrient intake. This is an important topic in studies of the prevalence of 
  the intake of different nutrients. Such studies provide backing for establishing 
  hypotheses regarding the relationships between diet and health. In assessing 
  diets within groups of individuals, it is often of interest to determine how 
  many of these individuals present intakes that are above or below a given criterion. 
  This information is relevant for planning healthcare actions, both in monitoring 
  and in assessing such interventions, and also for the purposes of regulating 
  commercial activities.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ASSESSMENT 
  OF DIETS WITHIN GROUPS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To estimate the 
  prevalence of inadequate intake of a certain nutrient, it is necessary to calculate 
  its consumption within the population group of interest and compare this with 
  reference standards. The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), one of the standards 
  available, are quantitative estimates for planning and assessing diets for healthy 
  populations that were initially developed by Americans and Canadians. The DRIs 
  include the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), as individual consumption 
  targets, and a further three additional standards: Adequate Intake (AI), Estimated 
  Average Requirement (EAR) and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). These concepts 
  have already been discussed in previous Portuguese-language publications.<sup>1,8,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The RDA, or some 
  percentage of it, has been utilized as a cutoff point for assessing the prevalence 
  of inadequate nutrient intake. This approach has led to erroneous quantification 
  of the proportion of individuals with inadequate intake.<sup>6</sup> Beaton 
  (1994)<sup>4</sup> suggested a method that, by comparing the distribution of 
  the habitual intake with the EAR, would lead to an unbiased estimate of the 
  prevalence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  methods presented in the literature for estimating the prevalence of inadequate 
  nutrition intake consist of probabilistic approaches and approaches using EAR 
  as a cutoff point. The latter method is considered to be a simplification of 
  the former<sup>9</sup> and, as well as being simple, it does not require great 
  parametrical presuppositions for its utilization.<sup>13,14</sup> Thus, EAR 
  is an appropriate reference estimate for assessing inadequate nutrient intake, 
  defined as the nutrient intake that corresponds to the estimated average need 
  for a given stage of life and gender.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this method, 
  the prevalence of inadequacy is the proportion of individuals whose intake is 
  less than the EAR. To utilize the EAR as a cutoff point, it is necessary to 
  determine the distribution of the habitual intake among the population, the 
  variance in food consumption and the EAR. The premises of the method are:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Nutrient need 
    and intake are independent variables.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The distribution 
    of the needs is symmetrical (and not necessarily normal).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The variance 
    in the intake of the distribution of the needs is relatively small in relation 
    to the variance in the distribution of the intake. Or in other words, the 
    individual variation in intake is greater than the variation of the needs 
    among the population.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Small deviations 
  in relation to these premises have a small effect on the performance of the 
  method. However, this method does not function well when consumption and need 
  are highly correlated, as is the case with energy, or with iron among women 
  of fertile age, whose needs are known to have asymmetrical distribution.<sup>4,6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ESTIMATION 
  OF THE HABITUAL DIET</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the assessment 
  of the inadequacy of the consumption, whatever the nutrient in question, it 
  is fundamental to determine the habitual diet, since the effects of inadequate 
  intake of the nutrient, no matter whether this is an excess or deficiency, will 
  not appear after only a few days. The <i>habitual diet</i> can be defined as 
  the average food consumption over a long period of time, over which a dietary 
  pattern is maintained.<sup>10,17</sup> On the other hand, the <i>present diet</i> 
  refers to the average food consumption over a short period of time around the 
  present day.<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quantitative 
  assessment of inadequacy of dietary intake requires an accurate determination 
  of the habitual quantities of foods consumed by the individual. It must take 
  into consideration all the foods that contribute towards the total nutrient 
  intake.<sup>9,11,20,21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the methods 
  most utilized for estimating the diet, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), 
  the 24-hour Recall (24hR) and Daily Records (DR) can be highlighted. The FFQ, 
  although it estimates the habitual diet and is greatly utilized in epidemiological 
  studies for verifying diet-disease relationships, rarely has sufficient accuracy 
  to be utilized for assessing the adequacy of nutrient intake, among individuals 
  or in groups. This is due to the particular characteristics of this method.<sup>21,13</sup> 
  In the FFQ, foods are presented on a pre-established list that therefore does 
  not consider all the foods available for consumption, and it utilizes standardized 
  measurements. In addition to this, different foods are often aggregated within 
  the same item.<sup>21</sup> More accurate estimates can be obtained by the methods 
  of Daily Records and 24-hour Recall. These methods, besides being based on individuals' 
  recent memories, allow open responses, thereby enabling a more detailed picture 
  of the population's consumption to be obtained.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consideration also 
  has to be given to the difficulty of accurately and precisely estimating the 
  diet, because of its variable nature.<sup>21</sup> The daily variability of 
  the diet depends on the real variation in foods consumed by individuals, which 
  is due to the diversity, heterogeneity and fluctuations in day-to-day consumption. 
  It must also be noted that individuals have intrinsically different characteristics, 
  such as preferences, which lead them to select distinct foods. Furthermore, 
  people may react differently on different occasions, for example at breakfast 
  time, when one day they eat biscuits and the next day they eat bread.<sup>5</sup> 
  According to Beaton et al<sup>3</sup> (1979), the influence of factors such 
  as seasonality, days of the week, sequences of questionnaire application or 
  different interviewers explains a small proportion of the variability in consumption. 
  Thus, the habitual diet could be explained by the following model:<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21093_enx1.gif"></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Y= nutrient intake</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#181; = true 
  average intake</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Individual i</i> 
  = effect of variance between individuals</font></p>
<p><font face="Symbol" size="2">e</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  = error term</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this model, 
  the habitual intake of a nutrient is formed by the true average (&#181;), influenced 
  by the effect of each individual in the population, for which the variability 
  is measured by the <i>variance between individuals</i> and is denoted by (S<sub>b</sub><sup>2</sup>). 
  Since this function cannot be measured directly, the true average intake cannot 
  be measured free of error.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variations 
  in the habitual intake given by day-to-day fluctuations in food intake can be 
  measured by the <i>variance within individuals</i>, denoted by (S<sub>w</sub><sup>2</sup>). 
  This function represents an individual's variability around his own average, 
  when and whenever it is evaluated through multiple observations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  these, a third source of variation must be mentioned: the variation given by 
  the measurement error of the instrument utilized. This is defined as the difference 
  found between the observed value and the true intake. The result of these two 
  components can be referred to as the error term (<font face="Symbol">e</font>).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimate of 
  the intake distribution includes an estimate of all the percentiles and allows 
  the subsequent calculation of other statistical parameters such as the arithmetic 
  mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and also tests of hypotheses 
  relating to the habitual intake.<sup>9</sup> Even if the average and median 
  values of the food intake for groups can be calculated with just one measurement, 
  within-person variance may distort the estimates of percentiles above or below 
  the average by increasing the total variance of the distribution, which makes 
  the distribution wider and inflated. Thus, an estimate of the prevalence of 
  nutrient intake within a defined population that is based on the consumption 
  on a single day may overestimate the percentage of individuals with inadequate 
  intake, regardless of whether the nutrient intake is excessive or deficient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The application 
  of statistical methods gives the possibility of removing the day-to-day variability 
  that is due to variation in within-person consumption. In such cases, the distribution 
  will then solely reflect the variation that exists between the individuals in 
  the group. The "adjusted" distribution of the habitual intake has less variance 
  than the distribution estimated using only one day of dietary intake (<a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21093_enf1.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To apply the statistical 
  methods to the adjustment of the diet, it is necessary to have at least two 
  independent measurements from at least one representative sample of the individuals 
  evaluated, on non-consecutive days. Only by means of repeated observations is 
  it possible to estimate the variability of the daily nutrient intake.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hoffmann et al<sup>9</sup> 
  (2002), in a study made with the objective of estimating the distribution of 
  dietary intake from repeated measurements over the short term, such as via the 
  use of multiple 24hR, concluded that only two repeated measurements were necessary 
  for this estimate, although the sample of the repeated days needed to cover 
  all the seasons of the year and days of the week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After choosing 
  the method, it must be emphasized that there are no methods capable of measuring 
  dietary intake exactly, or in other words, free from errors. Measurement error 
  is intrinsic to any method for assessing food consumption.<sup>2,21</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CALCULATION 
  OF THE PREVALENCE OF INADEQUATE CONSUMPTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After estimating 
  the distribution of the habitual intake, it must be verified whether this is 
  normally distributed. If it is not, a transformation to remove the asymmetry 
  can be suggested.<sup>7</sup> Logarithmic transformation is often utilized, 
  although this is just one of the alternatives. Following this, to estimate the 
  proportion of individuals whose habitual intake is above or below a given reference 
  value (EAR), the distribution of the nutrient must be obtained, free from the 
  effect of within-person variability.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is therefore 
  necessary to calculate the within-person variance (S<sub>w</sub><sup>2</sup>) 
  and between-person variance (S<sub>b</sub><sup>2</sup>). To obtain these components, 
  variance analysis (ANOVA) is utilized. It is stressed that, since the within-person 
  variance is of interest, at least two days of information for each person is 
  required.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimates of 
  within-person variance are calculated in accordance with the following relationships:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RMS<sub>w</sub> 
  = S<sub>w</sub><sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RMS<sub>b</sub>

  S<sub>obs</sub><sup>2</sup> of an observed distribution is given by the sum 
  of the within-person and between-person variances:<sup>18,7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rearranging equation 
  3, we have the relationship between the ratio of the standard deviation for 
  the whole population and the standard deviation of the within-person variation

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To remove the within-person 
  variance, the equation put forward by the US National Academy of Science Subcommittee 
  on Criteria for Dietary Evaluation can be used – equation 6.<sup>18</sup> For 
  data with normal distribution, this approach allows the reconstruction of the 
  whole distribution from the average and the variance, thereby also enabling 
  the recalculation of all the percentiles.<sup>18,9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21093_enx6.gif"></font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step is 
  to adjust the distribution of the nutrient, by utilizing the values obtained 
  from equation 6. Since the average is unaffected by the within-person variance 
  (S<sub>w</sub>), the adjusted distribution and the raw distribution must maintain 
  the same average value, although the dispersion of the values is expected to 
  be less.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final step 
  will be to verify the prevalence of inadequacy in the population group. For 
  this, the adjusted distribution is utilized, so as to remove the within-person 
  variability. This prevalence corresponds to the proportion of individuals in 
  the group whose habitual intake is less than the EAR established for the nutrient 
  (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To calculate the 
  area of the curve that corresponds to the proportion of individuals with inadequate 
  consumption, a distribution known as the reduced normal distribution is utilized:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n4/21093x7.gif"></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where:</font></p>

  deviation for the adjusted distribution</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EAR is the estimated 
  average requirement of the nutrient</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These calculations 
  require that the nutrient distribution should follow a normal distribution. 
  It is emphasized that these corrections are appropriate for estimates of groups 
  of individuals, but that they cannot be utilized for identifying <i>individuals</i> 
  who are below the cutoff point.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL 
  CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the errors 
  in assessing dietary intake derive from comparing average nutrient intake with 
  the RDA. When the average intake for a population or group extrapolates the 
  RDA, it may be concluded that the evaluated group has reached or exceeded the 
  recommendations. However, the RDA was established as a target for individual 
  consumption, as revised by the NRC (1980 and 1989).<sup>16,15</sup> In fact, 
  the variation in consumption generally exceeds the variation in the recommendation 
  for the majority of nutrients. The average for the habitual intake needs to 
  be greater than the RDA for there to be a low prevalence of inadequate consumption. 
  Even in the case of the average reaching or extrapolating the RDA, a certain 
  proportion of the individuals will present inadequate consumption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The median or average 
  for the intake of a population must not be utilized for estimating the prevalence 
  of inadequate consumption when this nutrient has an EAR. The prevalence of inadequacy 
  must be observed from the starting point of a distribution of the frequencies 
  of the intake values, with verification of the format and variability of the 
  curve for the population studied. In the case of nutrients without an EAR, prevalence 
  estimates utilizing these reference standards (the DRIs), <i>cannot</i> be made. 
  The DRI Committee<sup>9</sup> recommends caution in the interpretation of the 
  descriptive statistics (average, median and percentiles). When the average intake 
  of the nutrient exceeds the AI, it is expected that there will be low prevalence 
  of inadequacy. However, when the average intake of the nutrient for the population 
  is less than the AI, no conclusion can be reached in relation to the percentage 
  of individuals with inadequate intake of the nutrient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  the utilization of this methodology for nutritional recommendations other than 
  the DRIs, such as those from the Instituto de Nutrici&oacute;n de Am&eacute;rica 
  Latina y Panam&aacute; (INCAP) and Sociedade Brasileira de Alimenta&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  e Nutri&ccedil;&atilde;o (SBAN), it will only be possible when these recommendations 
  present the average value for the needs and not just the target intake to be 
  attained, as well as when the premises of the method are followed, of course. 
  Likewise, the defects already discussed in relation to the use of this approach 
  will continue to apply, in other words, the inflation of estimates of the prevalence 
  of inadequate intake of the nutrient in the population studied.</font></p>
