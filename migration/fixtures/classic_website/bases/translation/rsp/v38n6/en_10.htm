<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  describe the therapeutic practice of allopathic physicians and to evaluate the 
  outpatient care provided to patients in healthcare facilities.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The study was conducted in Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, southeastern 
  Brazil. World Health Organization drug use indicators were used as a methodological 
  basis. Our sample comprised 10 healthcare facilities, with 6,692 prescriptions 
  written by clinicians and pediatricians for the analysis of prescription indicators 
  and 30 patients of each facility for the analysis of patient care indicators. 
  The number of facilities varied according to each indicator. We used statistical 
  tests for the comparison of proportions.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>The mean number of drugs per prescription was 2.2, which is 
  compatible with data from the literature. The generic name of the medication 
  was used in 30.6% of prescriptions, a proportion considered as low. Antibiotics 
  were prescribed in 21.3% of prescriptions, with greater percentage among pediatricians 
  (28.9%). Injections were prescribed in 8.3% of prescriptions, with greater proportion 
  among clinicians (13.1%). The drugs prescribed in 83.4% of prescriptions were 
  part of the List of Standardized Drugs, indicating the acceptance of this list 
  by healthcare professionals. Mean duration was 9.2 minutes for appointments 
  and 18.4 seconds dispensation, both considered as insufficient for effective 
  patient care. 60.3% of all drugs prescribed were supplied. 70.0% of patients 
  interviewed had adequate knowledge of how to take the medication prescribed.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The care provided to patients is insufficient. Qualitative 
  studies are necessary in order to evaluate the different factors involved and 
  to plan future interventions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The synergy between 
  the Nineteenth Century's biomedical-organicist vision and the Twentieth Century's 
  technological innovations has had a range of consequences, which include an 
  option for the part to the expense of the whole, the interposition of several 
  factors in the physician-patient relationship, and the dehumanization of healthcare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this process, 
  drugs assume a major role in healthcare, both in terms of system management 
  policies and in the practice of the professionals involved, as well as in patients' 
  emotional references.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of factors 
  intertwine in the achievement of a rational use of medication  &#151; understood as 
  a process encompassing the appropriate prescribing, availability and affordability, 
  dispensation in adequate conditions, and consumption in the doses and periods 
  indicated, as well as at defined time intervals, of efficacious, safe and high-quality 
  medication.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a large 
  body of literature<sup>1,2,14</sup> on the range of factors acting upon the 
  prescriber when deciding upon which therapeutic regime to adopt: his or her 
  conceptions regarding the health-disease process; the quality of technical formation; 
  the sociocultural and economic conditions of the population at hand; the availability 
  of drugs in the facility; the sources of information to which the professional 
  has had access; and the pressure of the pharmaceutical industry, among others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surveys conducted 
  in different countries showed divergences that could not be explained by differences 
  in patterns of morbidity and mortality, whereas other reports found variations 
  in prescribing within a single country, often in response to identical clinical 
  presentations.<sup>9,14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to discuss 
  important aspects of the day-to-day practice of professionals, managers, and 
  users of the healthcare system and to securely evaluate crucial aspects of pharmaceutical 
  practice in the context of primary healthcare, the World Health Organization 
  (WHO) has developed the selected drug use indicators.<sup>7,13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, we employ these prescribing indicators to describe the therapeutic practices 
  of allopathic physicians, and evaluate patient care indicators.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, southeastern Brazil, is known for its importance as a regional reference 
  center for different areas of healthcare, as well as for the formation of healthcare 
  professionals. The city has a distinct socioeconomic scenario: despite its high 
  per-capita income, a large share of the population has low purchasing power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medication management 
  in the public network is done by the <i>Divis&atilde;o de Farm&aacute;cia e 
  Apoio Diagn&oacute;stico</i> (Division of Pharmacy and Diagnostic Support &#151; 
  DFAD) of the Ribeir&atilde;o Preto Municipal Secretariat of Health (RP-MSH). 
  In 1996, pharmacists were allocated solely to the <i>Unidades B&aacute;sicas 
  e Distritais de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Basic and District Healthcare Units &#151; 
  UBDS), supervising the pharmaceutical services of the various <i>Unidades B&aacute;sicas 
  de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Basic Healthcare Units &#151; UBS) within their area of 
  action. Dispensation in the latter was done by administrative agents, nursing 
  auxiliaries, and pharmacy auxiliaries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initial criterion 
  for the inclusion of healthcare units was that these units must include, among 
  their staff, both clinicians and pediatricians working during the entire day 
  shift (which yielded four UBDSs and 16 UBSs). Further criteria were adopted 
  for each group of indicators as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prescribing 
  indicators</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We studied 10 of 
  the initial 20 units (two UBDSs and eight UBSs). The other ten units were excluded 
  due to infrastructure problems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We analyzed 6,692 
  prescriptions written in May 1998, of which 3,326 were written by general clinicians 
  and 3,366 by pediatricians. Regarding the period studied, although there may 
  have been an influence of seasonal diseases in prescribing patterns, WHO considers 
  that a sample obtained at a given moment will show basically the same results 
  as another one involving a longer time period.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We studied the 
  prescriptions of physicians who saw patients for more than two days at the facility 
  during the entire period and who wrote more than 30 prescriptions. Physicians 
  whose work shift began as late as 4 p.m. were included in the study, since more 
  than 50% of their working time took place within the defined period (day shift).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We excluded prescriptions 
  written by physicians who performed both outpatient and emergency care in the 
  same unit, as well as prescriptions lacking date, signature, or seal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order for a 
  medication to be considered as prescribed by generic name, we used as a reference 
  the <i>Denomina&ccedil;&atilde;o Comum Brasileira</i> (Common Brazilian Denomination 
  &#151; DCB) and, in case of omission, the International Nonproprietary Names 
  for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN), as determined by current healthcare regulations.<sup>4,10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prescriptions employing 
  the commercial name of the medication but which contained the generic name in 
  parentheses and prescriptions in which the generic name was spelled incorrectly 
  were accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prescriptions containing 
  the expression '<i>solu&ccedil;&atilde;o fisiol&oacute;gica</i>' (physiological 
  saline) were was not considered as generic prescriptions (<i>prescri&ccedil;&atilde;o</i>). 
  The DCB indication<sup>10</sup> &#151; 0.9% sodium chloride &#151; was adopted 
  instead, for both nasal and injectable solutions. We also did not accept prescriptions 
  of B-complex vitamins and multivitamins as generic prescriptions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following WHO recommendations,<sup>12,13</sup> 
  sulfa drugs, but not metronidazole, were considered as antibiotics. Drug associations 
  in which one of the drugs was an antibiotic were considered as antibiotics regardless 
  of their pharmaceutical form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Lista de 
  Medicamentos Padronizados</i> (list of standard medications &#151; LMP) employed 
  was that of the RP-MSH valid in May 1998. Medications indicated in the pharmaceutical 
  form and with defined dosages were accepted as prescriptions, regardless of 
  whether commercial or generic names were used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were losses 
  during data entry due to the presence of prescriptions lacking pharmaceutical 
  form, or in which the form provided was inexistent. In these cases, the specific 
  medication was disregarded, but the remaining medications included in the prescription 
  were considered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data were entered 
  into a prescription control database developed especially for the present study. 
  Proportions were compared using chi-squared tests, and associations with p=0.05 
  were accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Patient care 
  indicators</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indicators <i>average 
  consultation time, average dispensing time, percentage of patients' knowledge 
  of correct dosage</i> were collected in 1996. The <i>percentage of drugs actually 
  dispensed</i> was calculated based on prescriptions written in 1998.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of patients 
  was defined according to WHO recommendations and, complying with the central 
  limit theorem, showed normal distribution with a 95% confidence interval.<sup>3,13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The percentage 
  of drugs adequately labeled was not measured, given that the procedure was not 
  yet standardized in the DFAD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Average consultation 
  time</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We accompanied 
  480 appointments in two UBDSs and 14 UBSs (15 appointments with general clinicians 
  and 15 with pediatricians in each unit). Time was measured using a stopwatch, 
  and the amount of time the patient spent in the consultation room was recorded 
  in minutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For patient selection, 
  we divided the desired number of appointments (30) by the number of physicians 
  at work in the unit on the day of collection. Following WHO recommendations, 
  we included the first patients seen by each prescriber.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data collection 
  was possible only in facilities in which the physical infrastructure allowed 
  us to distinguish the exact moments in which the patients were called to and 
  left the consultation room. In case the prescriber left the room temporarily 
  during the appointment, the watch was stopped until the prescriber returned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to better 
  evaluate and compare the results obtained, we established a classification based 
  on Statute no. 3,046 of the Brazilian Ministry of Health and on WHO, both of 
  which recommend 15 minutes as the appropriate duration for an appointment.<sup>18</sup> 
  This is the time frame employed by RP-MSH when scheduling physicians' daily 
  appointments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to this 
  classification, we considered appointment durations between 11.4 and 15.0 minutes 
  as excellent; 7.6-11.3 minutes as good; 3.8-7.5 minutes as regular; and 0.1-3-7 
  minutes as poor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Average dispensing 
  time</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Average dispensing 
  time was measured in four UBDSs and five UBSs, in which 15 patients were accompanied 
  in each period of the day (morning/afternoon), totaling 270 dispensations. This 
  indicator was investigated only in units whose structure allowed the investigator 
  to listen to the dialogue between patient and clerk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The definition 
  of the first timing to be done in each period was done at random, since timings 
  began only after the measurement of appointment durations was concluded. After 
  the first timing, all subsequent timings were done consecutively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The time consumed 
  with writing on files or with subjects unrelated to the drug being dispensed 
  was not considered. A stopwatch was used and time was recorded in seconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Percentage 
  of drugs actually dispensed</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to calculate 
  the percentage of medication dispensed, we used the same prescriptions used 
  for calculating prescribing indicators. In total, 16,386 drugs were dispensed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medications were 
  considered as dispensed when the standard DFAD stamp was present on the prescription 
  or when, in the absence of this stamp, a written statement conforming to the 
  unit's dispensation model was present. Dispensed medications identified as free 
  samples were not included.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Patients' 
  knowledge of correct dosage</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We carried out 
  600 interviews, following 30 patients (15 from the morning shift and 15 from 
  the afternoon shift) in each of the 16 UBSs and four UBDSs. All interviews were 
  carried out after the patient's consent was obtained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The choice of patients 
  was random, subjects being approached upon leaving the pharmacy. We evaluated 
  patients' knowledge of the dosage and timing of medication intake using a specific 
  questionnaire. Knowledge was not evaluated for drugs included in the prescription 
  but which were not dispensed by the pharmacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to better 
  evaluate the results, we established the following classification: a) Excellent: 
  76% to 100%; b) Good: 51% to 75%; c) Regular: 26% to 50%; d) Poor: 0,1% to 25,0%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indicators were 
  calculated based on the following ratios:</font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
<ol type ="a">
  <li> Average number of drugs per appointment (prescription) = total drugs prescribed/prescriptions 
    used. 
  <li> Percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name = total generic drugs prescribed/total 
    drugs prescribed x 100. 
  <li> Percentage of appointments (prescriptions) in which antibiotics were prescribed 
    = prescriptions in which at least one antibiotic was prescribed/total prescriptions 
    x 100. 
  <li> Percentage of appointments (prescriptions) in which an injection was prescribed 
    = prescriptions in which at least one injection was prescribed/total prescriptions 
    x 100 
  <li> Percentage of drugs prescribed included in the LMP = total drugs prescribed 
    included in the LMP/total drugs prescribed x 100. 
  <li> Average consultation time = sum of all consultation times/total no. of 
    consultations. 
  <li> Average dispensing time = sum of all dispensing times/total no. of samples. 
  <li> Percentage of drugs actually dispensed = drugs dispensed/drugs prescribed 
    x 100. 
  <li> Percentage of patients aware of the correct dosage = patients with correct 
    knowledge of the dosage of all drugs dispensed/patients interviewed x 100. 
</ol>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was no significant 
  difference between clinicians and pediatricians with respect to the average 
  number of drugs per prescription form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a significant 
  association between being a clinician and prescribing medications by generic 
  name, injectable drugs, and LMP drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prescription 
  of antibiotics was significantly associated with being a pediatrician (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_10t1.gif">Table</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Average consultation 
  time was 9.2 minutes for the entire sample, 8.3 minutes for clinicians, and 
  10.2 minutes for pediatricians. The analysis of individual units shows that, 
  with respect to appointment durations, 31.3% of units were classified as 'regular' 
  and 68.7% as 'good' or 'excellent'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall average 
  dispensing time was 18.4 seconds. The average time in the different units ranged 
  between 13.5 and 28,7 seconds (<a href="#f1">Figure</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean percentage 
  of drugs actually dispensed provided was 60.3%, ranging between units from 7.85% 
  to 75.1%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean percentage 
  of patients aware of the correct dosage was 70%, ranging between units from 
  43.3% to 93.5%. Awareness of the correct dosage was classified as 'regular' 
  in two units (10%) and as 'good' in 13 units (65,0%).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although there 
  were losses in the number of units investigated due to administrative and infrastructure 
  problems, we understand that this does not invalidate the results obtained, 
  and that this study provides important subsidy for the evaluation of the healthcare 
  provided to the population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  the mean number of medications per prescription &#151; which is intended to 
  evaluate the degree of polypharmacy &#151; the value found in the present study 
  (2.2 drugs per prescription) is compatible with the results of other Brazilian 
  studies by Cunha et al<sup>6</sup> (2.3); Lopes et al<sup>8</sup> (2.2); Pepe<sup>14</sup> 
  (2.16); Sim&otilde;es &amp; Fegadolli<sup>15</sup> (1.8); Sim&otilde;es &amp; 
  Motta<sup>16</sup> (1.9); and Sim&otilde;es &amp; Soler<sup>17</sup> (2.5).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a series of 
  studies conducted in other countries, the highest and lowest values found were 
  3.8 medications per encounter in Nigeria and 1.3 in Ecuador and Tanzania, respectively.<sup>7</sup> 
  Differences in terms of healthcare system characteristics, socioeconomic profile, 
  and morbidity and mortality characteristics in the population prevent inferences 
  from being made regarding the divergences observed. This pattern will repeat 
  itself whenever international data are analyzed, as will be the case for the 
  next indicators.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that, 
  within the Brazilian <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Unified Healthcare 
  System - SUS), medical and dentistry prescriptions must be done exclusively 
  using the drug's generic name,<sup>4,5</sup> the 30.6% of prescription by generic 
  name found in the present study was considered as low. The result is similar 
  to the 32.7% found by Sim&otilde;es &amp; Soller,<sup>17</sup> but is lower 
  than the values found in other studies (43.7% by Sim&otilde;es &amp; Fegadolli,<sup>15</sup> 
  72.0% by Sim&otilde;es &amp; Mota,<sup>16</sup> 74.0% by Lopes et al,<sup>8</sup> 
  and 84.3% by Cunha et al<sup>6</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These divergences 
  may reflect the use of different criteria by different researchers, as well 
  as a different profile of behavior of prescribers in the different regions studied. 
  As to the diversity observed between the present study and that of Sim&otilde;es 
  &amp; Mota,<sup>16</sup> both of which were conducted in Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, 
  this may be due to the use, by these authors, of prescriptions from a specialized 
  outpatient clinic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important interfering 
  factor is the existence, in the Brazilian pharmaceutical market, of medications 
  including a large number of associations. This may pose a difficulty to the 
  physician when prescribing &#151; be it due to deficiencies in training or to 
  the impossibility of consulting the DCB &#151; thus inducing physicians to prescribe 
  medications by their fantasy names.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, the prescription of antibiotics was more frequent among pediatricians 
  (28.9%) than among clinicians (13.7%). The overall rate in the present study 
  (21.3%) was higher than those found in Araraquara<sup>15</sup> (15.1%) and Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto<sup>16</sup> (10.1%), and lower than those found in Campo Grande<sup>6</sup> 
  (27.4%) and Fortaleza<sup>8</sup> (37.0%). Studies indicate that antibiotic 
  prescription rates are highest in Sudan (63.0%) and lowest in Bangladesh (25%) 
  and Ecuador (27,0%).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the 
  prescription of injections, the rates obtained were higher among clinicians 
  (13.1%) than among pediatricians (3.5%), with an overall rate of 8.3%. This 
  rate is similar to that found in Araraquara (7.4%).<sup>15</sup> The rates found 
  in Fortaleza<sup>8</sup> and in Campo Grande<sup>6</sup> were was 11.0% and 
  10,2%, respectively. Studies from other countries show a wide gap between maximum 
  (48.0%) and minimum values (0.2%).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For both these 
  indicators, the lack of a defined standard value hinders a critical analysis 
  of the differences observed between the results of the present and of other 
  studies. This is furthered by the impossibility of establishing a relationship 
  between the prescription studied and patients' clinical status.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main problem 
  with respect to antibiotics and their abusive prescription and use is the development 
  of microorganisms potentially resistant any type of treatment, bringing severe 
  and potentially lethal consequences to the patient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to injections, 
  as important as these may be in situations requiring emergency therapy or for 
  the absorption of substances in their active form, these drugs may lead to severe 
  consequences if erroneously prescribed or administered. Potential consequences 
  such as anaphylactic shock, tissue necrosis, or infections due to poor asepsis 
  must be carefully considered. This procedure is still especially prone to the 
  influence of cultural characteristics. One must therefore consider aspects such 
  as the population's attitude towards injections and how much this attitude may 
  influence prescription patterns. Children are particularly resistant to the 
  use of injections due to the pain involved in the procedure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">83.4% of all drugs 
  prescribed were included in the List of Standard Medications, which suggests 
  that standardization based on the epidemiological profile of the region's diseases 
  was adequate. However, another possibility is that the LMP may reflect the physicians' 
  prescription profile more than population morbidity and mortality profiles. 
  This phenomenon is defined by Pepe<sup>14</sup> as a "consensus between the 
  selection criterion and 'culturally consolidated' prescription practices."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Average consultation 
  time (9.2 minutes), despite being classified as 'good' according to the criterion 
  adopted, is below the 15 minutes recommended. Although this duration is longer 
  than that reported in the Brazilian literature, (5.8 minutes in Fortaleza, northeastern 
  Brazil,<sup>8</sup> and 5.5 minutes in Campo Grande<sup>6</sup>), this does 
  not necessarily mean that patients receive better care, since a number of factors 
  may influence the results of this indicator. In the international literature, 
  the mean duration was longest in Nigeria (6.3 minutes) and shortest in Bangladesh 
  (54 seconds).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO recommends 
  that pharmacists spend at least 3 minutes in orienting each patient. Therefore, 
  the duration of dispensation of 18.4 seconds found in the present study is inadequate 
  for proper pharmaceutical orientation. Such inadequacy was also reported in 
  the literature in Fortaleza<sup>8</sup> (17 seconds), Campo Grande<sup>6</sup> 
  (55 seconds), Nepal (86.1 seconds), Tanzania (77.8 seconds), Nigeria (12.5 seconds), 
  and Bangladesh (23 seconds).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The duration found 
  in the present study does not allow for the inclusion, during dispensation, 
  of important information, such as emphasis on the fulfillment of the dosage, 
  interaction with other medications, acknowledgement of potential side effects, 
  and conditions for appropriate product storage.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A follow-up of 
  the activities of the Ribeir&atilde;o Preto Municipal Secretariat of Health 
  DFAD has shown that, in the last years, a number of interventions aimed at improving 
  services have been implemented. Thus further studies are required in order to 
  evaluate the results of these interventions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The provision of 
  medications by the public network is of great importance when analyzed from 
  the medical-social standpoint. Brazil is a country with great social inequality. 
  Estimates indicate that over 50 million Brazilians are excluded from the consumption 
  of medication due to low purchasing power. Thus, even if diagnosis and prescription 
  are successful, the patient may still not reach therapeutic success due to lack 
  of access to the product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, 60.3% of all drugs prescribed were provided. This indicator is calculated 
  based on the prescription of all drugs and not only of those included in the 
  LMP, which prevents a more in depth discussion. A different methodology, based 
  on the evaluation of standardized medications only, may allow for a more qualified 
  evaluation of service management.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present result 
  may not correspond to the reality of the healthcare services. Certain factors 
  may have contributed to an underestimation of the actual level of dispensation, 
  including lack of a seal or annotation even when dispensation is fulfilled; 
  divergent patterns of annotation between staff members of a same pharmacy; and 
  lack of knowledge of the correlation between fantasy name (in the prescription) 
  and generic name (used in the service). On the other hand, the dispensation 
  of non-standardized medications made available, for instance, by state or federal 
  programs or through donation may bias this indicator upwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">70% of patients 
  were aware of the correct dosages for the medications received. Even though 
  these results suggest that, according to the classification established by the 
  authors, patients have good knowledge of the correct dosage, this is no guarantee 
  that the drug will be used correctly, since the methodology used is restricted, 
  and evaluates knowledge only partially.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order for treatment 
  to be effective, it is essential that the user receive information on different 
  issues, including: a) potential side effects; b) interaction with other medications 
  and foods; c) the importance of carrying out the treatment in its entirety &#151; 
  this is crucial, for instance, when antibiotics are used; and d) a correct understanding 
  of the therapeutic scheme, including the intervals that certain medications 
  require, such as for instance mebendazole and oral contraceptives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the mean 
  duration of dispensation observed is insufficient for adequate pharmaceutical 
  orientation, the levels of patient knowledge of dosage were high. This indicates 
  a need for qualitative studies, especially considering that the quality of the 
  information provided to the patient is essentially dependent on multiprofessional 
  work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though data 
  collection was performed in different years, we understand that this did not 
  bias our results, since these relate to different indicators and are discussed 
  separately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We therefore suggest 
  the following measures: a) conducting multicenter studies in regions with similar 
  epidemiological profiles, as a subsidy for the definition of standard values; 
  b) stimulating the development of therapeutic guides; c) creating continued 
  education programs that encourage prescribers towards more rational prescription 
  and dispensation personnel towards better orientation; d) compliance with generic 
  drug regulations, avoiding the writing of prescriptions not in accordance with 
  the standards; e) quantitative improvement of network pharmacy personnel; f) 
  developing qualitative studies in conjunction with healthcare services as a 
  means of evaluating factors involved in the non-rational use of medication; 
  g) introducing the labeling of the medication dispensed, thus contributing towards 
  an improvement in the healthcare provided.</font></p>
