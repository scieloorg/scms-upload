<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  determine factors associated with self-rated health among older adults, considering 
  five dimensions: sociodemographic variables, social support, lifestyle risk 
  factors, health status, and access to/use of healthcare services.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Of the 1,742 older adults (<u>&gt;</u>60 years) living in the town 
  of Bambu&iacute; (southeastern Brazil), 1,516 (87.0%) participated in the study. 
  Information was obtained by means of standardized interviews and physical and 
  laboratory exams.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Self-rated health as good/very good, reasonable, and poor/very 
  poor was reported by 24.7%, 49.2%, and 26.1% of subjects, respectively. The 
  following characteristics showed independent positive associations with worse 
  self-rated health: social ties (dissatisfaction with social network, attendance 
  to clubs and associations), health status (symptoms of depression/anxiety in 
  the last two weeks, sleeplessness in the last 30 days, greater number of prescribed 
  medications used in the last 30 days), and access to/use of healthcare services 
  (complaints when seeking medical care, greater number of medical appointments 
  in the last 12 months, greater number of hospital admissions in the last 12 
  months). An independent negative association was found with monthly family income 
  (&lt;2.0 <i>vs</i> <u>&gt;</u>4 minimum wages).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Our results show that self-rated health among older adults 
  is multidimensional in structure, being influenced by socioeconomic conditions, 
  social support, health status (with emphasis on mental health), and access to/use 
  of healthcare services. This structure resembles the definition of health adopted 
  by the World Health Organization (an individual's "physical, mental and social 
  well-being").</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rapid ageing 
  of the population, in both developed and developing countries, has led to a 
  search for simple indicators of health status capable of being used in both 
  health surveys and etiological studies. Self-rated health, determined by means 
  of a simple question &#151; <i>"Generally speaking, how do you consider your 
  health?"</i> &#151; or by other equivalent questions, is one of the indicators 
  most used in gerontological surveys, since it provides a robust and consistent 
  predictor for mortality and functional decline.<sup>11</sup> Self-rated health 
  is a better predictor of mortality than objective measures of health status.<sup>11</sup> 
  This reflects an individual's integrated perception of him or herself, which 
  includes biological, psychosocial, and social dimensions. <sup>12</sup> Moreover, 
  self-rated health shows good reliability and its validity is equivalent to that 
  of other more complex measures of health status. <sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, few 
  population-base studies have evaluated the distribution of self-rated health 
  among older adults. The most comprehensive data on this subject were collected 
  in the health supplement of the <i>Pesquisa Nacional por Amostras de Domic&iacute;lio</i> 
  (National Household Sample Survey), conducted in 1998 by the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> (Brazilian Institute 
  for Geography and Statistics &#151; IBGE). A study carried out using data from 
  this survey showed that only 24.5% of the elderly population in Brazil rated 
  their own health as good or very good. <sup>16</sup> However, this result must 
  be interpreted cautiously, since the perception of health involves a subjective 
  judgment, which cannot be determined by another person. In the aforementioned 
  survey, 38% of the interviews with older adults were answered by another person. 
  Prior epidemiological studies conducted in Brazil showed that the percentage 
  of older adults that considered their own health as good/very good varied, being 
  of 25% in Bambu&iacute;, <sup>17</sup> 44% in Rio de Janeiro, <sup>26</sup> 
  and 70% in S&atilde;o Paulo. <sup>21</sup> To our knowledge, there are no Brazilian 
  studies addressing the factors associated with self-rated health among older 
  adults.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  is part of the baseline of a population-based cohort of older adults, and is 
  aimed at determining factors associated with the self-rating of health, considering 
  five dimensions: (a) sociodemographic aspects, (b) social ties, (c) lifestyle 
  , (d) health status, and (e) access to and use of healthcare services.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Study area</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The municipality 
  of Bambu&iacute; is located in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern do Brazil, 
  at approximately 240 kilometres from state capital Belo Horizonte. At the time 
  of the survey, the municipality's population was 20,573 inhabitants, 73% of 
  which lived in the town. There was one physician for every 1,000 inhabitants 
  and no institutions for the elderly. Life expectancy was 70 years. Major causes 
  of death in the municipality were stroke, Chagas' disease, ischemic heart disease, 
  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (mortality rates =110.0; 61.4; 42.5, 
  and 18.9 per 100,000 population, respectively). Bambu&iacute; was formerly an 
  endemic area for Chagas' disease, but transmission of the infection by <i>Trypanosoma 
  cruzi</i> was interrupted about 20 years ago. Thus mortality by Chagas' disease 
  remains high in this population due to the cohort effect. Further details are 
  described in Lima-Costa et al<sup>17,18</sup> (2000, 2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Study population</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study participants 
  were identified based on the complete census of the study area, conducted by 
  our team between November and December 1996. All residents =60 years old as 
  of January 1<sup>st</sup> 1997 were selected for participation in the study. 
  Of the 1,724 inhabitants in this age group, 92.2% were interviewed and 85.6% 
  were examined (blood tests, blood pressure measurement, and electrocardiogram). 
  Data collection was carried out between January and August 1997. The participants 
  of physical and laboratory exams were similar to the town's population in all 
  aspects considered &#151; namely: age, sex, number of inhabitants in the household, 
  marital status, family income, and schooling. <sup>17</sup> All baseline participants 
  were selected for the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Interview</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following variables 
  &#151; the information for which was obtained at the baseline interview &#151; 
  were considered in the present study: (a) self-rated health <i>"Considering 
  the last six months, would you say that your health is very good, good, reasonable, 
  poor, or very poor?"</i>; (b) sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, schooling, 
  family income, marital status, number of generations living in the household); 
  (c) social ties (attendance to clubs and/or associations, attendance to religious 
  cults, satisfaction with social network); (d) lifestyle (current smoking, alcohol 
  consumption in last 12 months, physical activity during leisure time in last 
  90 days, fresh fruit or vegetable consumption in last 12 months); (e) disability 
  (inability to perform one or more of the following activities of daily living 
  : bathing, dressing, moving from bed to chair, eating and using the toilet); 
  (f) other indicators of health status (psychological distress in last 15 days, 
  sleeplessness in last 30 days, number of prescribed drugs used in last 90 days, 
  number of non-prescribed drugs used in last 90 days); and (g) indicators of 
  access to and use of healthcare services (main complaints when seeking medical 
  care, number of medical appointments in last 12 months, number of hospital admissions 
  in last 12 months). For further details, see Lima-Costa et al<sup>17</sup> (2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monthly family 
  income was determined by querying the respondent about the total monthly gross 
  income of the household. Family income was categorized into terciles, and the 
  low-income group was defined as the lower tercile (&lt;2.0 minimum wages).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to evaluate 
  psychological distress in last 15 days , a version of the 12 questions in the 
  <i>General Health Questionnaire</i>.<sup>6</sup> The cutoff point employed was 
  =4. The version used in the present study has been validated in Brazil previously.<sup>20</sup> 
  Insomnia was defined as the presence of any complaint in the last 30 days (difficulty 
  in initiating sleep, disrupted sleep, and/or early morning awakening), at least 
  three times during the week, with any level of inconvenience.<sup>22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews were 
  conducted by members of the community, selected from among those with at least 
  11 completed years of schooling. When the respondent was unable to answer to 
  the interview due to cognitive deficit or other health problem, another proxy 
  respondent was used. All interviews responded by a proxy were not considered 
  in the present study. The reliability of the interview was determined by reiterating 
  a random sample of questions from the original questionnaire to 10% of the participants.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Physical measurements 
  and laboratory exams</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blood pressure 
  measurements were carried out with the subject seated, after a five-minute resting 
  period and after at least 30 minutes without caffeine ingestion or smoking. 
  Three measurements were performed, the first of which was discarded. Arterial 
  pressure was considered as the mean of the second and third measurements. For 
  the present analysis, the cutoff points considered were 130 mm/Hg for systolic 
  pressure and 85 mm/Hg for diastolic pressure. Anthropometric measurements were 
  performed with the subject wearing light clothing. Only waist circumference 
  was considered in the present analysis. Cutoff points were 102 cm and 88 cm 
  for men and women respectively. Laboratory exams were performed on blood samples 
  collected after a 12-hour fasting period. The following cutoff points were employed: 
  110 mg/dl for glycemia, 150 mg/dl for triglycerides, 40 mg/dl for HDL cholesterol 
  in men and 50 mg/dl in women. We considered subjects as suffering from metabolic 
  syndrome when showing increased values in at least three of the five components 
  (waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemia), 
  considering the cutoff points defined above.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Serological exams 
  for <i>T. cruzi</i> infection were performed by hemagglutination and enzyme-linked 
  immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibodies were considered as present when both 
  tests were positive.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Data analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The characteristics 
  of older adults who rated their health as poor/very poor were compared to those 
  of the remaining subjects. Data analysis was based on Pearson chi-square and 
  linear trend chi-square tests (not presented) and on crude and adjusted odds 
  ratios.<sup>4</sup> Odds ratios were adjusted by multiple logistic regression.<sup>10</sup> 
  The criterion used for the inclusion of variables in the logistic model was 
  association with self-rated health below the 0.20 significance level. Variables 
  that remained associated with this variable below the 0.05 significance level 
  were kept in the final model. Analyses were performed using Stata software, 
  version 7.0.<sup>24</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 1,606 subjects 
  of the Bambu&iacute; baseline cohort, 1,516 participated in the present study 
  (90 subjects were excluded for requiring a proxy respondent for the interview). 
  591 men (39.0%) and 925 (61.0%) women participated in the present study. Participant 
  age ranged from 60 to 95 years (mean =69.0 years).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Self-rated health 
  was good/very good for 375 subjects (24.7%), reasonable for 746 (49.2%), and 
  poor/very poor for 395 (26.1%). Monthly family income was below 2.0 minimum 
  wages for 441 subjects (29.3%), between 2.0 and 3.9 for 568 subjects (37.7%), 
  and between 4.0 and 7.0 for 406 (33.0%).</font></p>

  1</a> presents the results of the bivariate analysis of sociodemographic factors 
  and social ties indicators associated with self-rated health. Sex, schooling, 
  monthly family income, marital status, attendance to clubs and/or associations, 
  attendance to religious cults, and satisfaction with social network were significantly 
  associated (p&lt;0.05) with self-rated health in this analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding lifestyles, 
  significant associations with self-rated health were found for alcohol consumption 
  in the last 12 months, physical exercise during leisure time in the last 90 
  days, and daily consumption of fresh fruit and/or vegetables. Current smoking 
  showed borderline significance (p=0.052) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_11t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following indicators 
  of health status were significantly associated with self-rated health in the 
  bivariate analysis: inability to perform daily living activities, psychological 
  distress in the last 15 days, insomnia in the last 30 days, metabolic syndrome, 
  presence of antibodies against <i>T. cruzi</i>, and number of prescribed drugs 
  used in the last 90 days (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_11t3.gif">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major complaints 
  when seeking medical care, number of medical appointments in the last 12 months,

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following variables 
  remained positively associated with worse self-rated health in the multivariate 
  analysis: dissatisfaction/extreme dissatisfaction with social network, psychological 
  distress in last two weeks, insomnia in last 30 days, number of prescribed drugs 
  used in last 30 days (1-2, 3-4, and =5), complaints when in need of medical 
  care (price of appointment or length of lines, as well as other complains), 
  number of medical appointments in last 12 months (2-3 and =4), and number of 
  hospital admissions in last 12 months (=2). A negative independent association 
  was found with monthly family income (=4 minimum wages). (<a href="#t5">Table

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our results show 
  that the structure of self-rated health in the population studied was associated 
  with four of the five dimensions investigated. Generally speaking, our results 
  confirm those of studies conducted in other countries, which show associations 
  between self-rated health and social support or social ties,<sup>4</sup> health 
  status<sup>23</sup> (including symptoms of depression<sup>8</sup>), access to 
  healthcare services,<sup>5</sup> medical appointments and hospital admissions.<sup>3</sup> 
  Associations between lifestyle risk factors (such as alcohol consumption and 
  smoking) and self-rated health were observed in some<sup>12</sup> but not all<sup>10</sup> 
  studies. In the present study, we found associations between lifestyle and self-rated 
  health in the bivariate analysis, but these associations disappeared after adjustments 
  for confounders. This result is coherent with the lack of association found 
  in this study between self-rated health and metabolic syndrome, and with prior 
  observations of the absence of an association between perceived health and coronary 
  risk profile.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Worthy of note 
  is the independent association found between self-reported health and family 
  income. Studies conducted in developed countries show that self-rated health 
  is strongly influenced by the socioeconomic situation of the older adult and/or 
  of his or her family. Such association has been found in ecological,<sup>11</sup> 
  cross-sectional<sup>15,18</sup> and longitudinal<sup>26</sup> studies. Our results 
  show that such influence may occur even between older adults with relatively 
  small differences in income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An anthropological 
  study conducted among older women living in t Bambu&iacute; town showed that 
  the evaluation of the severity and relevance of health-related problems was 
  determined to a greater extent by the subject's ability to face the problem 
  than by the problem itself. This ability was associated with family support 
  and with access to medical care, and increased or decreased along with purchasing 
  power.<sup>6</sup> The associations found in the present survey between worse 
  self-rated health and dissatisfaction with social network and worse socioeconomic 
  conditions are consistent with these observations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Methodologically 
  speaking, the main limitation of the present work is the cross-sectional nature 
  of the study. Cross-sectional studies do not allow for temporal relationships, 
  given that time information is not available. On the other hand, the study has 
  several advantages. Precautions were taken in order to avoid bias, such as double-blind 
  data collection, instrument reliability verifications, adoption of standardized 
  procedures and equipments, and exhaustive training of field and laboratory teams, 
  in addition to intensive activity inside the community in order to stimulate 
  participation in the study. Thus the quality of the information gathered and 
  the internal validity of the study were ensured. Furthermore, it is important 
  to highlight that one of the difficulties inherent to studies of the structure 
  of self-rated health is the need for a wide range of information, in order to 
  provide an adequate control of potential confounders. The Bambu&iacute; project 
  has a rich data bank, including information on a wide range of aspects related 
  to health and its determinants. This allowed us to explore the influence of 
  several characteristics on self-rated health, including that of health status. 
  Six indicators of health status were considered, four of which were based on 
  information collected during the interview and two of which were based on laboratory 
  exams and physical measurements. Metabolic syndrome and Chagas' disease were 
  chosen for being related to the major causes of death among older adults in 
  the studied area. This wide range of information allowed for a thorough control 
  of potential confounders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, our 
  results show the multidimensional structure of self-rated health among older 
  adults, which is influenced by socioeconomic conditions, social ties, health 
  conditions (especially psychological distress), and access to and use of healthcare 
  services. This structure is similar to the definition of health as "physical, 
  mental, and social well-being" adopted by the World Health Organization. Further 
  studies using longitudinal data are required in order to establish the temporal 
  relationships between the above mentioned dimensions (and/or their components) 
  and the evolution of self-rated health in this population.</font></p>
