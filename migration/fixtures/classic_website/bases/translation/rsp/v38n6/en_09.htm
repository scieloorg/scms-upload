<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  characterize the Brazilian philanthropic hospital network and its relation to 
  the public and private sectors of the <i>Sistema Unico de Saude</i> (SUS) &#91;Brazilian 
  Unified Health System&#93;.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>This is a descriptive study that took into consideration the 
  geographic distribution, number of beds, available biomedical equipment, health 
  care complexity as well as the productive and consumer profiles of philanthropic 
  hospitals. It is based on a sample of 175 hospitals, within a universe of 1,917, 
  involving 102 distinct institutions. Among these, there were 66 Brazilian Unified 
  Health System (SUS) inpatient care providers with less than 599 beds randomly 
  included in this study. Twenty-six of the twenty-seven SUS inpatient care providers 
  with at least 599 beds, as well as ten institutions which do not provide their 
  services to SUS, were also included. This is a cross-sectional study and the 
  data was obtained in 2001. Data collection was conducted by trained researchers, 
  who applied a questionnaire in interviews with the hospital's managers.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Within the random sample, 81.2% of the hospitals are located 
  in cities outside of metropolitan areas, and 53.6% of these are the only hospitals 
  within their municipalities. Basic clinical hospitals, without ICUs, predominate 
  within the random sample (44.9%). Among the individual hospitals of the large 
  philanthropic institutions and the special hospitals, the majority &#151; 53% 
  and 60% respectively &#151; are level II general hospitals, a category of greater 
  complexity. It was verified that complexity of care was associated to hospital 
  size, being that hospitals with the greatest complexity are situated predominantly 
  in the capitals.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Given the importance of the philanthropic hospital sector 
  within the SUS in Brazil, this paper identifies some ways of formulating appropriate 
  health policies adjusted to the specificities of its different segments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The philanthropic hospital sector in Brazil is responsible for
approximately one third of the existing beds in the
country,<sup>10</sup> comprising an important public and private
inpatient care provider within the Brazilian Health System.
Special programs of the Ministry of Health, as well as of the
governmental areas responsible for collecting taxes and
contributions, and economic institutions, such as the <i>Banco
Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&ocirc;mico e Social</i> (BNDES)
&#91;Social and Economic Development Bank&#93; are dedicated to this
sector. In this sense, the network of philanthropic hospitals
should be well characterized so that appropriate governmental
policies, directed towards its development and further
integration into the Brazilian health system, both in the private
and public sectors, may be formulated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article presents partial results of the "<i>Estudo sobre
os Hospitais Filantr&oacute;picos no Brasil</i>" &#91;Study on
Philanthropic Hospitals in Brazil&#93;,<sup>1</sup> a national survey
undertaken throughout the year 2001, by the <i>Escola Nacional de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica da Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Oswaldo
Cruz</i> &#91;National School of Public Health of the Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation&#93;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to present regulations<sup>2-6,12</sup> those
institutions certified as beneficent institutions of social
assistance by the <i>Conselho Nacional de Assist&ecirc;ncia
Social</i> (CNAS) &#91;National Council of Social Assistance&#93;, a
collegiate subordinated to the Ministry of Social Development and
Fight Against Hunger, are considered philanthropic institutions.
Several conditions are required in order to obtain this
Certificate. The Decree 4.327/2002:<sup>3</sup> establishes that
for hospitals to fulfill these requirements there are two
possible alternatives: they must offer and effectively provide
60% of their inpatient capacity to SUS; or, if the local SUS
manager declares that it is impossible to contract 60% of the
inpatient services, the institution must apply a percentage of
its gross income in providing services free of charge, varying
between 20% and 5%, depending on the effective percentage of SUS
inpatient care provided. A third alternative for obtaining the
Certificate according to the above-mentioned Decree is if the
hospital is classified as being strategic to SUS. However, the
criteria defined for fulfilling this classification and a list of
hospitals included within it, as established by the Ministry of
Health in 2002, was repealed in the beginning of
2003.<sup>2</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of 
  this article is to characterize the philanthropic hospitals in terms of their 
  geographic location, their size, available biomedical equipment, health care 
  complexity and productive profile as well as the characteristics of their clientele.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This cross-sectional 
  study is based on data collected from interviews undertaken by trained interviewers 
  who applied a questionnaire. Considering the universe of Brazilian philanthropic 
  hospitals, three subsets of hospital institutions were constructed: (a) a random 
  sample of 66 institutions that are SUS inpatient care providers, from which 
  were excluded those institutions with at least 599 beds &#151; <i>random sample</i>; 
  (b) the universe of 27 SUS inpatient care provider institutions with at least 
  599 beds &#151; <i>large institutions</i>; and (c) ten institutions intentionally 
  selected due to the recognition they have acquired in the market for the quality 
  of care they deliver, among the universe of philanthropic institutions that 
  are not SUS inpatient care providers &#151; <i>special hospitals</i>. In the 
  first segment, there were four refusals leading to replacements, and the 66 
  institutions included in the study correspond to 69 hospitals. Among the 27 
  <i>large institutions</i>, there was one refusal without replacement, resulting 
  in the inclusion of 15 individual hospitals &#151; institutions which maintained 
  a single hospital &#151; and 11 hospital conglomerates &#151; institutions constituted 
  by at least two hospitals, designated as component hospitals of conglomerates 
  &#151; involving a total of 81 hospitals. In the third subset of <i>special 
  hospitals</i>, there were three refusals with replacements. A total of 175 hospitals 
  were investigated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the conglomerates' component hospitals in particular,
the instrument utilized to collect data was filled out by the
hospital directors themselves. In this case, the trained
researchers were only responsible for filling out the
questionnaires of these large institutions' headquarters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to classify the counties in which these hospitals are
located, data from the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estat&iacute;stica</i> (IBGE) &#91;Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics&#93;, concerning the number of inhabitants, as well as
the delimitation of metropolitan regions<sup>9</sup> was
utilized. A logical flow of the classification of the hospitals'
profiles and complexity of care was constructed, which took into
consideration the reported medical specialties and consistency
with the number of physicians, of available beds, and of critical
biomedical equipment in use in the Intensive Care Units (ICU),
and data concerning the high complexity hospital procedures
undertaken.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SAS<sup>&reg;</sup> 
  System for Windows statistical package, version 8.2, was utilized.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Geographic distribution</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#f1">Figure 
  1</a> indicates the distribution of these hospitals throughout Brazil, according 
  to the segments under consideration, and <a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> details 
  this distribution according to the size of the counties and their location in 
  or outside metropolitan areas and capitals.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is noteworthy that most (81.2%) of the hospitals from the
<i>random sample</i> are located outside the metropolitan region,
and that, among these, the majority (53.6%) are the only
hospitals within their counties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fifty per cent of the hospitals within the <i>large
institutions</i> are located in counties outside metropolitan
areas. Considering only those hospitals that belong to
conglomerates, 54% are located outside metropolitan areas.
Furthermore, a great dispersion in their distribution may be
observed, for 81 of the hospitals of the 11 conglomerates are
located in 69 counties. Only two conglomerates concentrate their
hospitals in the same county. Thirty-six hospitals pertaining to
conglomerates (44%) and two of the 15 individual hospitals
included in this study were located in counties with less than
200 thousand inhabitants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of the 10 <i>special hospitals</i> studied are situated in
the Southern or Southeastern regions, and in counties with more
than 200 thousand inhabitants; eight of these are located in
state capitals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Number of beds</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the hospitals from the <i>random sample,</i> 75.3% have
up to 100 beds, excluding special accommodations (ICUs and
others). The average number of existing beds and of those being
used is, respectively, 79.7 e 76.7. The average number of beds
among all inpatient establishments in Brazil is 62.1; this rises
to 65.7 when only the private establishments are taken into
consideration.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the <i>large institutions</i>, 11 of the 15 individual
hospitals have at least 599 beds. This also occurs among eight of
the 11 conglomerates, five of which have more than 900 beds. An
important variation in size may be noted among the hospitals
belonging to conglomerates, 39 of which (48%) presented less than
100 beds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a whole, the segment represented by the <i>large
institutions</i>, is responsible for nearly 20 thousand beds,
which corresponds to approximately 13% of the total number of
beds within philanthropic hospital sector, according to the
IBGE.<sup>10</sup> On the other hand, it corresponds,
approximately, to only 5% of the hospitals within the segment of
<i>large institutions</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the <i>special hospitals</i>, only one of them stated it
had less than 50 beds, while the rest stated they had more than
100 beds. The average number of beds within this segment was
calculated in 234.2, which is considerably larger than the
average within the <i>random sample</i> (79.7) and the private
establishments in Brazil (65.7).<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Biomedical equipment</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seventeen of the 
  hospitals within the <i>random sample</i> do not even have portable X Rays (see 
  <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>), which depicts their precariousness in terms of 
  diagnosis. Considering equipment that express higher levels of complexity in 
  care, only 12 hospitals had mammograms and 12 had CAT Scans (see <a href="#f3">Figure 
  3</a>), one hospital had magnetic resonance and four hospitals had hemodynamic 
  equipment, which is indispensable in cardiac care and more complex heart surgery. 
  Half of the hospitals stated they had no equipment based on optical methods, 
  generally related to better diagnostic and therapeutic conditions. The endoscope 
  for the upper gastrointestinal tract was registered by 43.5% of these hospitals, 
  and the video laparoscope, and important equipment for surgical procedures, 
  was registered by only 24 hospitals (35%). The equipment referred to above are 
  found, largely within hospitals in the state capitals. For example, all hospitals 
  located in the capitals declared they had fixed X-Ray equipment, while only 
  33 of the 56 hospitals located outside metropolitan areas declared they had 
  this equipment.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="f3"></a></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_09f3.gif" width="429" height="355"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Differential patterns 
  of incorporation of equipment may be observed when <i>large institutions</i>, 
  particularly individual hospitals within these, are compared to hospitals within 
  the <i>random sample</i>. The presence of at least one CAT Scan (see <a href="#f3">Figure 
  3</a>), considered a differentiating variable in terms of the incorporation 
  of equipment, is registered in 11 hospitals. As to equipment based on optical 
  methods, 12 hospitals stated they had endoscopes for the upper gastrointestinal 
  tract, and only eight stated they disposed of video laparoscopes. The conglomerates' 
  hospitals once again manifest characteristics that are similar to those of the 
  random sample's hospitals. Fixed or portable X-ray equipment were not available 
  in 23 of the 81 hospitals included in this study segment. An expressive number 
  of CAT Scans (24) and magnetic resonance equipment (11) was reported. The CAT 
  Scans are equally divided among the hospitals in the capitals and outside the 
  metropolitan region, and most (8 out of 11) of the magnetic resonance equipment 
  is located in the capitals. The availability of endoscopes for the upper gastrointestinal 
  tract and of video laparoscopes was reported by, respectively, by 37% and 36% 
  of these hospitals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The segment of <i>special hospitals</i> presents the greatest
incorporation of equipment. It should be noted that all ten
hospitals had at least one CAT Scan, eight stated they had
magnetic resonance equipment and nine had X-rays for hemodynamic
monitoring. Furthermore, eight hospitals stated they had video
laparoscopes and surgical microscopes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Complexity of care</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The level of complexity considered herein is the result of a
classification developed within the scope of this study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#f4">Figure 
  4</a> presents the distribution of the hospitals included in this study, according 
  to their segment and the classification of care they deliver.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_09f4.gif" width="430" height="463"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the <i>random sample</i>, a predominance of basic clinic
hospitals without ICUs (44.9%), in which the average number of
beds was 39.7, may be observed. The majority (74%) did not have
ICUs. Only five hospitals (7.2%) were classified as <i>level II
general hospitals</i>, and none was registered as <i>specialized
hospitals</i>. Furthermore, 50.7% of the hospitals within this
segment did not report any special beds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Focusing, simultaneously, 
  on size and complexity of care among the hospitals in the <i>random sample</i>, 
  it was verified that the smaller ones were also less complex. The highest average 
  number of beds was found among the <i>level II general hospitals</i> &#151; 
  183.6 beds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 51 hospitals within the <i>random sample</i> that do
not have ICUs, 96% are situated in counties with up to 200
thousand inhabitants, and no level <i>II general hospitals</i>
are found in the smaller counties (less than 20 thousand
inhabitants).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the hospitals in the <i>large institutions</i> segment,
a distinction must be made between individual hospitals and those
that are components of conglomerates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Individual hospitals, 
  have the largest number of beds registered, and are among those with the greatest 
  complexity. None of their units are <i>basic clinic hospitals</i>. Eight of 
  the 15 hospitals were classified as <i>level II general hospitals</i>, being 
  noteworthy that the two specialized hospitals that do not have ICUs are psychiatric 
  hospitals. An extensive list of medical specialties also distinguishes these 
  hospitals from others, being that eight of them included the head and neck surgical 
  specialty, an important expression of surgical differentiation, among their 
  specialties. Twelve of the 15 hospitals declared they had intensive care beds; 
  however, only ten fulfill the conditions proposed by the care classification 
  system for the maintenance of ICUs. Seven of the eight hospitals classified 
  as <i>level II general hospitals</i> develop educational activities &#151; residency 
  programs, medical specialties, Masters and Ph.D. degrees and/or institutional 
  clerkships for undergraduate students. Two hospitals offer all the types of 
  courses listed above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, hospitals within conglomerates are more
evenly distributed among the different levels of complexity,
being that 47% have ICUs. Those that are less complex are located
primarily outside the cosmopolitan areas. Among the 15 with the
highest complexity, six are located outside metropolitan areas,
six are located in capitals, and three in metropolitan areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the group 
  of <i>special hospitals</i>, all except one have ICUs for adults and 60% are 
  situated in the category of hospitals of the greatest complexity &#151; <i>level 
  II general hospitals</i>. Twenty-one services or medical specialties are registered 
  within these hospitals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production and consumer profile</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Practically all 
  the hospitals within the <i>random sample</i> &#151; 65 hospitals (94%) &#151; 
  are identified as SUS inpatient care providers, when registry of inpatients 
  is taken into consideration; 58 hospitals (84%) register services for health 
  care plans and health insurance companies; 54 hospitals (78%) register services 
  to private patients; and only four hospitals (8,6%) register services for their 
  own health care plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the hospitals from the <i>random sample</i>, 75.2% of
all inpatient services are directed towards SUS patients, 20% to
health care plan and health insurance policy holders, 4.3% to
private clients and only 0.5% to the hospital's own health
insurance plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only 16% and 17% of the hospitals in the <i>random sample</i>
provide high complexity inpatient care and outpatient care for
SUS, respectively. Only one hospital reported doing medulla
transplants, but not for SUS. Six hospitals provide neurosurgical
services and one of these does not offer these services to SUS
patients. Two hospitals declared they offer kidney transplants
and none undertake cardiac, lung or liver transplants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must be stressed that, upon considering the exams
undertaken by hospitals in the <i>random sample</i>, SUS patients
are very important clients, for 92.1% of the CAT Scans, for
example, are solicited for them. The concentration of exams in
the capitals is significant (70.6%), corroborating that despite
the fact that this sector has a strong presence outside the
metropolitan areas, the greatest complexity in the supply
structure is located in large urban centers. Innovative
activities in terms of care and of greater hospital
organizational rationality are practically non-existent. Home
care is reported by only one hospital, only for SUS, and only
four hospitals stated they provide outpatient services for both
SUS and non-SUS clients.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the individual hospitals within the large institutions
provide services to SUS, including, at least, inpatient care.
Among the 15 hospitals studied, 12 reported they produce services
for health plans and health insurance companies, 13 for private
clients and 4 for their own health plans. Considering the total
volume of inpatients admitted to hospitals within this segment,
70% are SUS patients, 16% are occupied by health plans and health
insurance clients, 2% are private clients and 12% are clients
covered by the hospital's own health plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten hospitals stated they undertake high complexity procedures
in outpatient services and six stated that high complexity
hospital procedures are provided for SUS. Among the former, the
following procedures are available to patients: eight of the ten
hospitals provide hemodialysis; seven, peritoneal dialysis;
seven, chemotherapy; and five, radiotherapy. Among the latter,
all six hospitals stated they undertook cardiac surgery, kidney
transplants and neurosurgery, three hospitals stated they
undertook medulla transplant and two stated they provided liver,
heart and lung transplants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Innovative activities in terms of care and of greater hospital
organizational rationality are incipient, being that home care is
provided by only three hospitals and outpatient services are
provided by five hospitals; in both cases, these services are
provided to SUS as well as non-SUS clients.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, among the conglomerates' component hospitals,
within the segment of <i>large institutions</i>, 74% provide
inpatient services for SUS, 65% for health plan and health
insurance holders, 69% for private patients and only one hospital
for its own health plan. Six of the 11 conglomerates stated that
all their hospitals provide inpatient services for SUS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUS patients represent 72.6% of the volume of inpatient
services provided by the conglomerates' component hospitals,
19.7% are holders of health plans and insurance policies, 3.7%
are private patients and 4% are clients of the hospitals' own
health plans. The significance of the volume of services produced
by the latter when compared to all other types of hospitals and
clients is noteworthy for it refers to a single hospital. Only 15
hospitals (18.5%) declared they provide high complexity
outpatient procedures and 11 (13.6%) provide high complexity
hospital procedures for SUS inpatients. Among the latter, 13
provide neurosurgery, five cardiac surgery, three kidney
transplants, two medulla transplants, one liver transplants and
one cardiac transplants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Innovative activities in terms of care and of greater hospital
organizational rationality are practically non-existent, being
that home care is provided by only two hospitals and outpatient
care is provided by seven hospitals, for SUS as well as non-SUS
clients in both cases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the 
  total volume of inpatient services provided by the <i>special hospital</i> segment, 
  it should be noted that only 0.5% is provided for SUS patients, 92% is provided 
  for health plan and insurance policy holders &#151; the clientele targeted by 
  this segment &#151; 3.6% for private clients and 3.9% for those who have the 
  hospital's own health plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although they are not registered as service providers for SUS,
the special hospitals present themselves as providers of high
complexity procedures for inpatients. SUS registry is not
obligatory for this kind of service. The local SUS administrator
establishes direct contracts with some private health service
providers according to the demand for hospital resources.
Considering only the services provided for SUS among these
hospitals, six undertake cardiac surgeries, five neurosurgeries,
three medulla transplants, two liver transplants, two kidney
transplants and one cardiac transplant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to high complexity outpatient procedures, 72.1% of the
hemodialysis and 48.5% of the peritoneal dialysis are provided
for SUS patients. As to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, 100% of
the production is provided to non-SUS clients.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the CAT scans 
  and magnetic resonance, these exams are provided to SUS patients, but the latter 
  represent a small portion of the production &#151; 17.5 % e 9.1%, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group of special 
  hospitals is the segment in which innovative activities are present to the greatest 
  extent, although they are still limited. Home care is provided by two hospitals, 
  outpatient care by five hospitals for non-SUS clients.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the size of the network of philanthropic
hospitals, its expressive capillarity and geographic extension
throughout the national territory as well as the significant
volume of SUS inpatient care it provides, it becomes clear that
this sector deserves special attention when public health
policies are being formulated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategic role played by the philanthropic hospital sector
as the only SUS inpatient care provider in a significant number
of counties outside metropolitan areas, as well as a provider of
higher complexity services in capitals and large cities, is also
noteworthy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUS and the philanthropic 
  hospital sector maintain an interdependent relation, considering all segments 
  included in this study, except the special hospitals, as expected. According 
  to data from Datasus, of the total number of SUS hospital registries in 2000, 
  37.6% are in philanthropic hospitals.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hospitals in the <i>random sample</i> and the <i>large
institutions</i> segment were similar to one another in terms of
the elevated number of SUS inpatients attended. On the other
hand, the complexity of procedures provided to clients
differentiates these two segments. The <i>special hospitals</i>,
with their elevated technological capacity, are important service
providers for health plans and insurance policies. The latter
also provide high complexity procedures, particularly outpatient
services, for SUS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was found that hospitals with higher complexity of care
profiles tend to have a greater number of beds. It may be
suggested that technological concentration, in terms of
equipment, installation and, naturally, specialized
professionals, requires a larger number of beds, so that the
economic investment involved has a higher probability of
obtaining adequate financial returns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the importance and penetration of the philanthropic
hospital network in Brazil, a significant portion of this network
displays economic and administrative fragility that threatens its
survival. In addition to these aspects, clearly demonstrated by
the "Estudo sobre os Hospitais Filantr&oacute;picos no
Brasil",<sup>1</sup> &#91;Study on Philanthropic Hospitals in
Brazil&#93;, other more general issues must be taken into
consideration when defining the role to be played by this sector
in the Brazilian Health System:<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(a) The decreasing 
    rate of occupation of the hospitals, a tendency that may be explained by the 
    lack of demand or technological inadequacy to attend to the demand;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(b) The impact 
    of the reorganization of primary care &#151; involving models such as, for 
    example, the Family Health Program, and the increasing technological complexity 
    of outpatient care &#151; that lends greater capacity of resolution to that 
    level of care and creates other demands for more complex levels of care;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(c) The need 
    to guarantee access, whenever necessary, to services of greater complexity 
    to populations of smaller counties, situated far from large urban centers;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(d) The demand 
    for other structures of nursing care and social assistance that make it possible 
    to care for patients with chronic diseases and resulting social problems, 
    particularly, within an ageing population.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These elements, 
  of relevance to hospital care, may guide the formulation of policies that induce 
  the configuration of a better integrated public hospital network, where roles 
  are more clearly defined and better articulated to SUS at other levels of care 
  &#151; primary care, specialized outpatient care and home care &#151; and which 
  can respond more appropriately to fluctuations in the demographic profile as 
  well as in the profile of population morbidity and mortality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The philanthropic hospital sector needs to be considered in
its diversity, demanding, of course, differential actions and
policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smaller hospitals, with lower complexity of care, that are
situated predominantly outside the metropolitan areas, are
frequently the only hospitals in their counties and present the
greatest risks in terms of survival. They need to incorporate new
administrative tools and learn to use them efficiently. They also
require measures of adjustment both on the part of the public
agents and of their own directors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The challenge they face is to migrate to projects that are
more compatible with the proposals of extension and that provide
greater resolution with respect to demands from primary care.
Possible antagonistic paths point towards either the conversion
of these units into nursing homes,<sup>8,11,13</sup> or to their
acquisition of appropriate equipment and human resources, so as
to provide more specialized hospital services. Furthermore, the
possibility of building collaborative networks with other
hospitals, whether or not these are also philanthropic, so as to
guarantee greater efficiency of care as well as in financial and
administrative terms, should be contemplated.<sup>7</sup> It
should not be denied, however, that the philanthropic hospital
sector plays a strategic role in guaranteeing vulnerable
populations access to health care, as well as in recruiting and
maintaining physicians in these more remote
sites.<sup>8,13</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the individual hospitals and the components of
conglomerates of higher complexity, particularly those situated
in counties outside metropolitan areas, they might play the role
of regional reference centers, requiring adjustments, principally
in terms of their integration within the network of health
services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the potential 
  role of special hospitals in providing SUS and supplementary health segments 
  with highly specialized services should be considered.</font></p>
