<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bioassays were 
  performed in order to detect the susceptibility of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> to the 
  chemical insecticides temephos and cypermethrin. The results showed that this 
  species is susceptible to temephos and presents resistance to cypermethrin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategies 
  for controlling the principal vector of dengue, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, are based 
  on the utilization of chemical and biological products, integrated with environmental 
  management programs. In Brazil, the programs that aim to control <i>Aedes aegypti</i> 
  mainly utilize chemical insecticides, among which organophosphates (OP) and 
  pyrethroids (P) are prominent. These programs require constant monitoring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The numbers of 
  dengue cases are rising every year, and different factors influence this increase. 
  Resistance to chemical products may favor an increase in the mosquito populations, 
  thereby resulting in increases in the numbers of dengue cases.<sup>1,4</sup> 
  For this reason, it is important to perform periodic monitoring of the susceptibility 
  to insecticides of the populations implicated in the transmission of this disease.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study presents 
  data on the susceptibility of a population of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in the city 
  of Curitiba, State of Paran&aacute;, for the first time. This population was 
  submitted to two chemical insecticides: temephos (organophosphate) and cypermethrin 
  (pyrethroid). The resistance ratio was compared with the data for the standard 
  colony at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immature specimens 
  were collected from different districts of Curitiba between January and April 
  2003. <i>Aedes aegypti</i> was only found in the sample from the Uberaba district, 
  in an artificial breeding ground (automobile wreckage in a scrap metal yard). 
  This was the only population originating from Curitiba utilized in the susceptibility 
  tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lineage utilized 
  for making the comparison was the Rockefeller CDC. The insecticides utilized 
  in the bioassays were temephos, "Temephos Fersol 1G" (granulated, 1%), and cypermethrin, 
  "Cynoff 400 Pm" (powder, 25%). These products were diluted in mineral water 
  to prepare the standard solutions with the same concentration of 50 ppm of active 
  ingredient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process for 
  the bioassays followed the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO).<sup>5</sup> 
  The results were submitted to Probit analysis.<sup>2</sup> The following criteria 
  were utilized for determining the resistance: if the mortality rate was greater 
  than or equal to 98%, the sample was considered to susceptible; if the mortality 
  rate was 80 to 97%, the response was checked by repeating the experiment; and 
  if the mortality rate was less than 80%, the sample was considered to be resistant.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A total of 750 
  larvae were analyzed in relation to cypermethrin and 700 in relation to temephos, 
  including the various concentrations and the control. The test performed on 
  larvae of Aedes aegypti from Curitiba, utilizing a diagnostic concentration 
  of 0.0125 ppm of active ingredient of the organophosphate temephos, resulted 
  in a survival rate of 10% and mortality rate of 90%. In the test using temephos 
  at multiple concentrations, an LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0046 ppm of active ingredient 
  (RR<sub>50</sub> =1.7) and an LC<sub>95</sub> of 0.0191 ppm of active ingredient 
  (RR<sub>95</sub> =4.7) were found. For cypermethrin, the survival rate was 35% 
  and the mortality rate was 65% in the evaluation utilizing a diagnostic concentration 
  of 0.0125 ppm of active ingredient. In the evaluation of multiple concentrations, 
  an LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0096 ppm of active ingredient (RR<sub>50</sub> =27) 
  and an LC<sub>95</sub> of 0.0275 ppm of active ingredient (RR<sub>95</sub> =4) 
  were found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diagnostic 
  concentration of 0.0125 ppm of active ingredient of temephos and cypermethrin 
  was also utilized to test the colony of Rockefeller lineage. This concentration 
  of both insecticides produced a mortality rate of 100%. For cypermethrin, an 
  additional diagnostic concentration of 0.009 ppm of active ingredient was evaluated, 
  and this also resulted in a mortality rate of 100%. In the multiple concentration 
  analyses for temephos, LC<sub>50</sub> was 0.0027 ppm of active ingredient and 
  LC<sub>95</sub> was 0.0400 ppm of active ingredient. For cypermethrin, LC<sub>50</sub> 
  was 0.00035 ppm of active ingredient and LC<sub>95</sub> was 0.00741 ppm of 
  active ingredient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The values presented 
  indicate that chemical treatment using temephos is viable. However, the level 
  of susceptibility in relation to the diagnostic and multiple concentration tests 
  suggest that a system of constant monitoring of this mosquito population should 
  be rapidly implemented. The results confirm the need for preventive strategies 
  and alternative control methods that might diminish the selection of resistance. 
  The selection process appears to have begun within this population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results for 
  cypermethrin indicate that this product should no longer be utilized within 
  the municipality of Curitiba. They suggest that there is a need for immediate 
  replacement of this insecticide by some other product of chemical or biological 
  origin.</font></p>
