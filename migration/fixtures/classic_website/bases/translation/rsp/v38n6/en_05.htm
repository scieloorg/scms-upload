<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>The 
  evaluation of quality and equity in healthcare attendance requires adequate 
  study methods and information systems. Thus, this study was performed with the 
  objective of comparing mortality among elderly patients attended within the 
  private network and within the Brazilian national health system (SUS).<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>An information system that recorded causes of hospitalization 
  and associated diseases (comorbidity) in relation to public and private hospital 
  admissions was utilized. The hospitalization of 21,695 patients in Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, in 1998 and 1999 was studied. These patients 
  had diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Analysis was done via 
  the methodology put forward by Charlson, in which comorbidities are scored to 
  give the Charlson comorbidity index and age over 50 years (per decade) is scored 
  to give the Charlson comorbidity-age index. The patients were stratified according 
  to comorbidity and decade of age over 50 years, with separation of hospitalizations 
  via SUS from those via the private network (non-SUS). The coefficient of hospital 
  mortality was calculated for each stratum.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>It was observed that the risk of death increased almost sixfold 
  when the number of associated diseases increased. The risk of death for SUS 
  patients was more than twice the risk for non-SUS patients (relative risk: 2.12). 
  Significant differences between SUS and non-SUS patients were found by associating 
  the patient's comorbidity with decade of age. When the risk of death was very 
  low or very high, there were no statistical differences between SUS and non-SUS 
  patients. In other, intermediate situations, precisely where the attendance 
  might make a difference, the mortality among SUS patients was more than twice 
  as great (relative risk: 2.14).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The difference in mortality between SUS and non-SUS patients, 
  according to Charlson's criteria, is significant among patients of intermediate 
  risk, for whom the care is most important. The Charlson comorbidity index correlates 
  with hospital mortality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several studies 
  have given evidence of the relationships of social inequality with healthcare, 
  such as in relation to the risk of becoming ill, progression of the illness, 
  consumption of services and differences in medical attendance.<sup>1,13,16,18,22,23</sup> 
  Yazlle Rocha<sup>24</sup> (1997) found in the municipality of Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, Brazil, that hospitalizations among economically active individuals formed 
  two social subsets. Professions with higher incomes, and members of their families, 
  were predominant among hospitalizations within the private network, while workers 
  of lower income predominated among hospitalizations within the public network. 
  By analyzing patients who progressed to death within the three funding systems 
  &#151; private, healthcare plans and the public system &#151; these authors 
  observed differences in the coefficient of hospital mortality, average duration 
  of hospitalization and average age of the patients. Subsequently, also in Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, Guedes<sup>15</sup> (2000) worked on the hospitalizations that took place 
  during 1998 and showed that the average age of individuals hospitalized through 
  the Brazilian national health system (<i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  &#151; SUS) was less than in the private network (non-SUS), and that the rate 
  of hospital mortality among SUS patients was greater than among non-SUS patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ideal would 
  be a single, universal medical system, independent of whether services were 
  provided by public assistance or private entities. This would enable there to 
  be conditions of equity for the different social strata in relation to healthcare. 
  For this reason, quality and performance assessments for healthcare services 
  have gained prominence, along with comparative analyses of outcome indicators, 
  with emphasis on hospital care (Martins,<sup>17</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hospital mortality 
  is a traditional indicator of hospital performance and will probably continue 
  to be so for a long time. It expresses a crucial dimension of the quality of 
  the care provided: the final outcome. Among the performance indicators, hospital 
  mortality has been utilized for identifying variations between providers that 
  can be attributed to quality problems.<sup>2,3,8,9,11,14</sup> Nonetheless, 
  differences between hospitals may be derived from medical practice, the profile 
  of cases treated, or the interaction between these elements. The risk factors 
  for the death of patients (seriousness of the cases) are the variables for adjusting 
  hospital mortality rates in comparative studies. According to Blumberg<sup>2</sup> 
  (1986), adequate adjustment is very important in this type of study, since patients 
  with different health characteristics that imply different treatments cannot 
  be analyzed as if they were similar. Comparisons of the lengths of hospital 
  stay, costs or mortality imply determination of the extent to which the observed 
  differences can be attributed to the type of case admitted or the differences 
  in the treatment (Martins,<sup>17</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knowledge of the 
  severity, numbers and seriousness of the diseases coexisting with the principal 
  diagnosis (cause of hospitalization) is important for predicting complications 
  and unfavorable outcomes among hospitalized cases. DesHarnais<sup>8</sup> (1988) 
  emphasized that the weight of secondary diagnoses (comorbidities) on the seriousness 
  of the case varies according to the principal diagnosis, such that certain combinations 
  of morbid conditions present greater risk than others. So far, the use of risk 
  measurements for adjusting outcome indicators has been infrequent in Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of 
  the present study was to apply the methodology proposed by Charlson et al<sup>4</sup> 
  (1987) to a hospital database, for adjusting outcome indicators among patients 
  of over 50 years old in the region of Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, and to compare 
  the mortality observed among such patients attended by the private network with 
  the mortality among such patients attended by SUS.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To form their comorbidity 
  index, Charlson et al<sup>4</sup> (1987) defined 17 clinical conditions. The 
  method utilizes these clinical conditions, which are annotated as secondary 
  diagnoses, for measuring the seriousness of the case and weighting the effect 
  of these conditions on the patient's prognosis, so as to adjust the risk. Scoring 
  is established for each of the clinical conditions, on the basis of the relative 
  risk, with weights ranging from zero to six (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charlson also presented 
  the possibility of utilizing this comorbidity index in combination with age 
  (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>), thereby forming a single index from these two. 
  Thus, the scoring described in <a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>, for the comorbidities 
  receives the addition of specific weighting that corresponds to the patient's 
  age. In this way, one point is attributed for each ten-year period, starting 
  from the age of 50 years. For example, for a patient aged 70, three points are 
  attributed (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>). This quantity is added to the other 
  score, if this individual presents any of the comorbidities listed in <a href="#f1">Figure 
  1</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Charlson comorbidity 
  index was originally proposed for use in longitudinal studies of chronic diseases, 
  in which previous hospitalizations are generally considered.<sup>4,5</sup> However, 
  there is evidence that it has validity for measuring the seriousness of cases 
  in a single hospitalization.<sup>6,7,10,17,19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The database for 
  the study was the hospital data processing center of a medical teaching institution 
  in Ribeir&atilde;o Preto. This center is responsible for all the hospitals in 
  the city (14 hospitals) and a further 22 hospitals in other municipalities in 
  the region, and it continually receives hospital statistics from them. From 
  1998 onwards, with the utilization of the Tenth Revision of the International 
  Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the system started to record in the database 
  up to four secondary diagnoses, as well as the principal diagnosis. The information 
  is checked, coded and electronically processed, and goes through a consistency 
  program that checks for 33 types of incoherencies, contradictions and inconsistencies 
  (Sim&otilde;es,<sup>21</sup> 1991).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In comparison with 
  other databases, this one presents some advantages: a) universal coverage of 
  all hospitalizations, whether or not these were funded by SUS; b) the possibility 
  of annotating up to four secondary diagnoses; c) it reflects practically all 
  the demand for hospitalization in the region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample studied 
  included all the hospitalizations that took place in the region of Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto during the period from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 1999. Patients 
  aged 50 years or more who were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis that 
  is included in chapters IX and X (respiratory tract and circulatory diseases) 
  of ICD-10 were selected. In addition to this, these patients were selected because 
  their hospitalization was motivated by a great probability that death might 
  occur: this event was utilized here as an outcome measurement. Patients were 
  included if they presented a definitive diagnosis causing the hospitalization 
  that was among the following diagnostic groups: ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25), 
  cardiac insufficiency (I50), hypertensive diseases (I10-I15), cerebrovascular 
  diseases (I60-I69), or influenza and pneumonia (J10-J18).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In accordance with 
  the above criteria, a total of 21,695 cases were selected. After sorting the 
  cases according to the principal diagnosis as defined by ICD-10, the respective 
  weighting for each case was applied, in conformity with the numbers and severity 
  of secondary diagnoses, following the methodology recommended for the Charlson 
  comorbidity index (CCI) and also the Charlson comorbidity-age index (CCAI). 
  The program utilized was Epi Info 6.04D. Thus, a 62-year-old patient hospitalized 
  because of hypertensive disease who presented chronic obstructive pulmonary 
  disease as a comorbidity would receive a score of one from the CCI and three 
  from the CCAI. If this patient also presented a secondary diagnosis of congestive 
  cardiac insufficiency, the score would be two from the CCI and four from the 
  CCAI. Once the cases were weighted in this manner, the overall results were 
  analyzed and matching was done between the mortality indices, now adjusted, 
  for the patients attended by SUS and by the private network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#t1">Table

  diagnosis and the age group. The two age groups that predominated were 60 to 
  69 years and 70 to 79 years, accounting for practically 60% of all cases. The 
  most frequently found diagnostic groups were influenza and pneumonia (J10-J18) 
  and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25), which together totaled practically 50% 
  of the cases.</font></p>

  of hospitalizations according to hospital category resulted in 12,406 hospitalization 
  through SUS and 9,289 through non-SUS. The general hospital mortality index 
  was 12.1 among SUS patients and 9.4 among non-SUS, thus resulting in a relative 
  risk of 1.29 times more for SUS patients, using the chi-squared test, with statistical 
  significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is wide-ranging 
  debate and interest regarding the quality of the medical services offered to 
  the general population. This interest is even greater when it comes to public 
  services funded by the government and destined for everyone. Such services are, 
  however, mainly utilized by the more needy population that does not have the 
  means for access to medical services within the private network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In evaluating hospital 
  deaths, the central concern must be focused on identifying the deaths that can 
  be considered to be avoidable. It has to be recognized that there is a risk 
  of death that is inherent to the patient and defines his chances of survival, 
  but that quality problems in the patient care process may increase this risk.<sup>12,20</sup> 
  In this light, and for a given evaluation to be valid, the differences in risk 
  factor prevalence between patients attended in different hospitals or by different 
  doctors need to be taken into consideration. Such differences modify the seriousness 
  of cases attended and, thus, similar treatment for groups with different nosological 
  and attendance profiles should be avoided. This is particularly important when 
  patients from the public network and private network are compared, because it 
  may often be the case that different and non-comparable populations of patients 
  are being dealt with. Yazlle Rocha &amp; Sim&otilde;es<sup>25</sup> (1999) highlighted 
  the negative aspects of how patients are selected for SUS in the region of Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, considering that, as well as attending to the patients who are financially 
  needy, SUS ends up being responsible for the cases that are more complex, more 
  burdensome and less resolvable. Thus, the higher mortality found in the present 
  study among SUS patients, in absolute and relative terms, may be the result 
  of the greater complexity or seriousness of the cases attended by the public 
  network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The application 
  of the CCI to SUS and non-SUS patients shown in <a href="#t3">Table 3</a> indicates 
  that, in the initial band of CCI equal to zero (absence of comorbidity), in 
  which the majority of patients are concentrated, the mortality is low for both 
  groups. In subsequent bands, there is progressive raising of the mortality rate 
  concomitant with increased scoring from the CCI. In the final bands, mortality 
  rates that are much greater than the average are reached, thus showing that 
  there is a correlation between the CCI scoring and mortality. When the mortality 
  for SUS and non-SUS patients is compared after adjustment by the CCI (<a href="#t3">Table 
  3</a>) is compared, some interesting findings are noted. In all the CCI scoring 
  bands, mortality is greater for SUS patients than for non-SUS patients, as can 
  be seen from the relative risk (RR). Nonetheless, in the absence of comorbidity 
  (CCI = zero) the difference is almost non-existent (RR=1.03) and without statistical 
  significance. For the greatest scores (CCI=4 and CCI&gt;4), which represent 
  the cases of greatest risk, although differences exist, these too are not statistically 
  significant. The differences only acquire statistical significance at intermediate 
  scores (CCI=1, CCI=2 and CCI=3), or in other words, at scores that the methodology 
  aims to identify as medium-risk and for which the attendance care given is certainly 
  more decisive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The application 
  of the CCAI to all the cases (<a href="#t4">Table 4</a>) also reflected this 
  reality, and the result was very similar to what was found when the CCI was 
  applied, with increased mortality for the bands of greater scores, for both 
  groups. <a href="#t4">Table 4</a> shows the result from this comparison, in 
  which the mortality for SUS patients is always greater, as shown by the relative 
  risk. These differences too are not significant in the initial bands, while 
  reaching statistical significance in the intermediate bands. Just in this case, 
  in the band of greatest CCAI (CCAI&gt;7), despite having a small number of patients, 
  the difference reached the level of significant, because of the very high mortality 
  among patients attended by SUS, in relation to non-SUS patients (71.4% and 41.7%, 
  respectively). The medical and hospital care is less relevant if the risk of 
  death is very low or very high, and gains greater importance in intermediate 
  cases, in which the attenuation of the risk of dying is the most desired result.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yazlle Rocha<sup>24</sup> 
  (1997) and Guedes<sup>15</sup> (2000) found that the average age among patients 
  hospitalized through SUS is generally lower than for non-SUS patients. In the 
  first adjustment (<a href="#t3">Table 3</a>), in which only the comorbidities 
  were considered (CCI), this lower average age may have favorably influenced 
  the result among SUS patients, even though a greater mortality rate persisted. 
  When the adjustment took the age group into account (CCAI; <a href="#t4">Table 
  4</a>) and when the age was the preponderant factor, which was the case of the 
  matching for the more advanced age groups that naturally are more fragile, the 
  mortality within SUS was notably greater than for non-SUS patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, it must 
  be considered that it would be of great interest to have a standardized index 
  that was reliable and feasible and would allow comparisons of patients with 
  similar diagnoses but with differing degrees of complexity or seriousness, thereby 
  contributing towards better assessment of the attendance provided. Such initial 
  differentiation might result in greater care dedicated at earlier stages to 
  cases that are more complex.</font></p>
