<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  assess factors associated with drug use among adolescent students from schools 
  providing secondary education.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>A cross-sectional study was carried out in Pelotas, Southern 
  Brazil, in 1998. An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was answered 
  by a proportional sample of 10-19-year-old students, enrolled in primary (5<sup>th</sup> 
  grade and further) and secondary classes in all public and private schools of 
  the urban area which providing secondary education. Schools were visited up 
  to three times in order to reach absent students. Results were expressed as 
  prevalence ratios (PR).<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>2,410 students were interviewed, losses amounting to 8%. The 
  prevalence of drug use (except alcohol and tobacco) in the last year was 17.1%. 
  After confounder control, associations remained between drug use and parents' 
  divorce (PR=1.46; 95% CI: 1.18-1.80), poor relationship with father (PR=1.67; 
  95% CI: 1.17-2.38), poor relationship with mother (PR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.64-4.48), 
  open-minded father (PR=1.36; 95% CI: 1.08-1.72), drug user in household (PR=1.61; 
  95% CI: 1.17-2.18), abuse (PR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.27-2.07), having been mugged or 
  robbed in the previous year (PR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.09-1.76) and absence of religious 
  practice (PR=1.31; 95% CI: 1.07-1.59).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The study suggests associations between several family characteristics 
  and drug use by adolescents, providing useful information for a complete understanding 
  of this problem in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The history of 
  drug production and use is part of the history of humanity itself. In the last 
  decades, however, due to its increased frequency, drug use has become a worldwide 
  public health problem, awakening the interest of researchers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, comparisons 
  between studies conducted prior to 1986 were difficult because of differences 
  in the methodologies employed, poorly defined sampling strategies, and sometimes 
  questionable statistical analyses.<sup>4</sup> In 1986, a new generation of 
  surveys began, which were based on questionnaire elaborated by the World Health 
  Organization (WHO) and adapted for Brazil. This questionnaire allowed for the 
  standardization of studies and for the comparison of the results obtained.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several studies 
  using anonymous self-administered questionnaires have been carried out with 
  the objective of studying the prevalence of drug use.<sup>3,8,10,11,17,18</sup> 
  The Brazilian Center for Information on Psychotropic Drugs (<i>Centro Brasileiro 
  de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Drogas Psicotr&oacute;picas</i> &#151; CEBRID) 
  carried out four nationwide surveys (1987, 1989, 1993, and 1997) among adolescent 
  students in 10 Brazilian capitals.<sup>8</sup> Data from these surveys indicate 
  that adolescence is a time of exposure and vulnerability to substance use, and 
  that experimenting drugs is a frequent phenomenon. For some adolescents, the 
  improper use of substances will be only part of his or her development, ceasing 
  as the adolescent matures. Others, however, will develop problematic usage, 
  which may interrupt the normal process of adolescence and bring about severe 
  consequences to the lives of these individuals.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Few studies have 
  been conducted addressing the risk factors for drug use among Brazilian adolescents, 
  and most of the information available in this regard comes from studies carried 
  out in other countries. In addition to sociodemographic factors (sex, age, social 
  class), studies indicate associations between drug use and parental or familiar 
  involvement with alcohol or drugs, not being raised by both parents, low perception 
  of maternal and paternal support, absence of religious practice, and lesser 
  frequency of sports practice.<sup>7,12,13,16</sup> Protective factors include 
  trust in parents and peers, religious involvement (participation in youth groups, 
  trust in religious advisers , belief in God, and ability to pray ), educational 
  expectations (being considered as intelligent, being among the best students 
  in class), and having less conflicts and divorce attempts in the family.<sup>14,16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian literature 
  highlights especially the importance of sociodemographic factors, which are 
  the subject of most studies.<sup>10,11,17,18</sup> In addition to these factors, 
  Carvalho et al,<sup>6</sup> in a national sample of students, identified domestic 
  violence and the quality of family relationships as important factors related 
  to drug use, while Baus et al<sup>3</sup> found an association between drug 
  use and parents' divorce and not living with parents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  was aimed at investigating factors associated with drug use in a representative 
  sample of adolescents attending schools providing the Brazilian <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i> 
  (9<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup> grades).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This cross-sectional 
  survey was carried out between August and November 1998. Pelotas, the city in 
  which the study took place, is located in the Southern Region of Brazil, at 
  about 240 km from state capital Porto Alegre. According to the 2000 census, 
  conducted by the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> 
  (Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics &#151; IBGE), Pelotas has 
  301,081 inhabitants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sampling was systematic, 
  stratified (public and private schools, <i>ensino fundamental</i> (1<sup>st</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> 
  grades) and <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i>, and day and night shifts), and with 
  a probability proportional to the size (number of students) of all schools in 
  the urban area of the city with <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i>. The sampling universe 
  was composed of 24 schools, of which 12 were run by the state government, 9 
  were private, two were federal, and one was municipal, and comprised 27,990 
  students enrolled between 5<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> grades, which correspond 
  approximately to the 10-19 years age group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sample size was 
  calculated using Epi Info software, v. 6.02, assuming a 20% prevalence of <i>use 
  of drugs in lifetime</i> in unexposed individuals, a 95% confidence level, 80% 
  statistical power, a relative risk of 2.0, and a prevalence of exposure &#151; 
  psychiatric morbidity and stressful events &#151; of 3%. A further 30% was added 
  for confounder control and 10% for losses, amounting to a total 1,960 individuals. 
  Estimating the average class size at 20 students, 100 classes were randomly 
  selected, amounting to an estimated total of 2,000 students. We employed an 
  anonymous self-administered questionnaire, comprising 128 questions, most of 
  which were pre-coded. For data on drug use, we used the instrument model proposed 
  by WHO (1980) and adapted to Brazil by Carlini-Cotrim &amp; Barbosa.<sup>5</sup> 
  Questionnaires were administered collectively, in class, without the presence 
  of the teacher, and were placed into opaque envelopes. In order to administer 
  the questionnaire to students absent during the first visit, interviewers returned 
  to the schools up to three subsequent times. The envelops containing the questionnaires 
  of each class were taken to the schools during the return visits, so that further 
  questionnaires could be placed amidst the previous ones, ensuring anonymity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dependent variable 
  was the pattern of non-medical use of psychotropic drugs (solvents, marijuana, 
  cocaine, anxiolytics, amphetamines, anticholinergics, barbiturics, opioids, 
  hallucinogens, and orexins, among others). For this analysis we employed the 
  WHO definition of <i>use in the last year</i>: used at least once in the twelve-month 
  period preceding the survey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Independent variables 
  comprised characteristics related to social class (determined by the criteria 
  of the <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira dos Institutos de Pesquisa de 
  Mercado</i> &#151; Brazilian Association of Market Research Institutes),<sup>9</sup> 
  reformulated in 1991, which considers the possession of consumer goods and the 
  level of schooling of the head of the family, demography (age and sex), environment 
  (living conditions, sanitation, and crowding), family (parents' marital situation, 
  relationship between parents, and between parents and child), religious practice 
  (belief in God, habit of praying when facing difficulties, regular participation 
  in youth groups or other religious activity in the last year), sports practice 
  (physical activity in the last year, frequency of physical activity), and stressful 
  events (in lifetime: sexual abuse, mistreatment, presence at home of person 
  with chronic disease and of alcohol or drug user; in the twelve months prior 
  to the survey: parents' divorce, death in the family or of other significant 
  person, unemployment of the head of the family, mugging or theft, change of 
  neighborhood or city).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data was collected 
  between August and November 1998 by a team of 21 Medicine, Nursing, and Social 
  Science students.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical analysis 
  was performed using SPSS v. 8.0, Epi Info v. 6.02, and Stata Intercooled v. 
  6.0 software. Considering that the students of larger classes had greater chance 
  of being included in the sample, data were weighted according to the inverse 
  of this probability. Moreover, considering the possibility of an identity of 
  behavior between students of a same class, the effect of the design was taken 
  into consideration by identifying the variable <i>class</i> as the sampling 
  unit. This was accomplished using the <i>survey PSU</i> (Pimary Sample Unit) 
  option, available in the Stata package.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimates obtained 
  with bivariate analysis were expressed as prevalence ratios (PRs) and statistical 
  significance was verified using chi-squared or linear-trend tests (for ordinal 
  variables).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since in cross-sectional 
  studies with highly prevalent outcomes the odds ratio tends to overestimate 
  the PR, we used Poisson regression with a robust variance estimate in the multivariate 
  analysis in order to estimate PRs directly, as suggested by Barros &amp; Hirataka.<sup>2</sup> 
  Variables associated with the outcome with a significance level =0.2 were included 
  in the model. Variable inclusion was done by levels, according to a previously 
  established conceptual model (<a href="#f1">Figure</a>). Variables associated 
  with the outcome with a significance level = 0.05 (measured by Wald's test) 
  were kept in the model.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the total 3,080 
  students registered in the selected classes, 461 were outside the age group 
  targeted by the study (10-19 years), so that 2,619 students were included. Of 
  these, 14 (0.5%) refused to participate and 168 (6.4%) were absent during all 
  visits. We administered 2,437 questionnaires, of which 27 (1.0%) were annulled 
  (11 due to positive answer to a question regarding a fictitious drug and 16 
  for having more than 4 questions annulled or less than 50% of the questionnaire 
  filled), yielding a total 2,410 valid questionnaires. Final loss rate was 8.0%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sample distribution 
  in terms of sociodemographic variables shows that the 14-16 years age group 
  concentrated the greatest number of subjects (44.6%), followed by the 17-19 
  years group (32.8%). A little over half the sample was of females (56.4%). Most 
  subjects were single (98.0%) and had white skin (81.9%). 55.4% of students attended 
  <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i>, 79.0% attended public schools, and 82.5% attended 
  school during the day. Regarding social class, 73.2% of subjects belonged to 
  classes B and C, the lowest prevalence being of found for class E (2,9%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of drug use (excluding alcohol and tobacco), in the last year was 17.1% in the 
  subjects studied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_06t1.gif">Table 
  1</a> shows the results of the crude analysis of drug use according to sociodemographic 
  characteristics, physical activity, and religious practice. There was a linear 
  association between drug use and social class, with prevalence ratios decreasing 
  from the higher to the lower classes. Subjects in class D and E reported 50% 
  less drug use when compared to those in class A (PR<sub>class D</sub>=0.53; 
  95%CI: 0.32-0.88; PR<sub>class E</sub>=0.45; 95%CI: 0.18-1.08). There was a 
  linear increase in prevalence with age, reported use among subjects in the 17-19 
  years group being more than twofold that of the 10-13 years group (PR=2.64; 
  95%CI: 1.83-3.91). There was no significant difference in drug consumption between 
  girls and boys (RP=0.94; 95%CI: 0.79-1.13).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_06t1.gif">Table 
  1</a>, we can see the absence of an association between drug use and practice 
  or frequency of physical activity in the last year. As to religion, we can see 
  that, although no single type of religious belief showed association with drug 
  use, religious practice in general was significantly associated with the outcome, 
  subjects not reporting religious practice showing a roughly 40% greater prevalence 
  of drug use than those who did practice religion (PR=1.44; 95%CI: 1.18-1.75). 
  Likewise, those who reported not believing in God showed a 60% greater prevalence 
  of drug use than believers (PR=1.63; 95%CI: 1.06-2.52). Participation in youth 
  groups and the habit of praying were not associated with drug use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_06t2.gif">Table 
  2</a> shows the results of the bivariate analysis of drug use in relation to 
  family relationship and environmental factors. Subjects whose parents were divorced 
  reported more than 50% greater use than those whose parents lived together (PR=1.55; 
  95%CI: 1.26-1.90). Subjects whose parents had never lived together, or with 
  one or both parents dead showed no significant difference when compared to those 
  whose parents lived together. Subjects that reported a poor or very poor relationship 
  with father or mother showed a significantly higher drug consumption than those 
  that reported a good or excellent relationship with father (PR=2.04; 95%CI: 
  1.44-2.88) or mother (PR=2.77; 95%CI: 1.90-4.03). Likewise, greater drug use 
  was reported by subjects who considered their fathers or mothers as 'open-minded' 
  (RP<sub>father</sub>=1.34; 95%CI: 1.05-1.70; PR<sub>mother</sub>=1.26; 95%CI: 
  1.02-1.57) when compared to those who considered their father or mother as 'authoritarian'. 
  As to the relationship between parents, drug use was reported more frequently 
  among students whose parents had an average (PR=1.34; 95%CI: 1.04-1.74) or poor 
  or very poor relationship (PR=1.61; 95%CI: 1.13-2.28), when compared to those 
  whose parents maintained a good or excellent relationship. Concerning environmental 
  factors, drug use was related to type of residence, being 30% lower among subjects 
  living in houses (of any type) than among those living in apartments. Likewise, 
  drug use was inversely related to crowding in the household (number of individuals 
  per bedroom), being roughly 50% lower among subjects living in households with 
  three or more individuals per bedroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still considering 
  crude analysis, <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_06t3.gif">Table 3</a> shows the relationship 
  between drug use and the occurrence of stressful events. Drug use was significantly 
  associated with presence in the household of a relative that drinks excessively 
  (PR=1.50; 95%CI: 1.19-1.90), presence in the household of a user of other drugs 
  (PR=1.98; 95%CI: 1.42-2.76), and having suffered mistreatment (PR=1.92; 95%CI: 
  1.51-2.45). Likewise, victims of mugging or theft in the last year reported 
  significantly higher drug use (RP=1.59; 95%CI: 1.25-2.02). History of sexual 
  abuse, presence in the household of a relative with chronic disease, occurrence, 
  in the last year, of unemployment of the head of the family, parents' divorce, 
  death of a significant person, or change of neighborhood were not significantly 
  associated with drug use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_06t4.gif">Table 
  4</a> shows crude results and results adjusted by the multivariate analysis 
  for factors associated with <i>use in the last year</i> of psychotropic drugs 
  (excluding alcohol and tobacco). In the first level, social class showed a linear 
  association with the outcome, with prevalence ratios decreasing from the highest 
  to the lower classes. Age, also included in the analysis at this level, also 
  showed a linear association with drug use, there being an increase in use along 
  with an increase in age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second level 
  &#151; <i>environmental variables</i> &#151; included type of residence and 
  crowding. These variables did not maintain a significant association with the 
  outcome after confounder control. Variables related to familiar relationship 
  were also included in this level. Parents' divorce maintained a significant 
  association with drug use, the children of separated couples reporting drug 
  use over 40% more frequently that the children of couples who lived together 
  (PR=1.46; 95%CI: 1.18-1.80). Likewise, poor or very poor relationships with 
  both father and mother remained significantly associated with greater drug use 
  in last year when compared with good relationship, being related to an almost 
  threefold increase in prevalence (PR=2.71; 95%CI: 1.64-4.48) in the case of 
  the relationship with the mother. In addition, considering the father as 'open-minded' 
  maintained its association with greater drug use by the adolescent (PR=1.36; 
  95%CI: 1.08-1.72). As to stressful events, drug use maintained its positive 
  association with presence of drug user in the household (PR=1.62; 95%CI: 1.17-2.18), 
  occurrence of mistreatment &#151; a roughly 60% increase (PR=1.62; 95%CI: 1.27-2.07), 
  and occurrence of mugging or theft in the last year (PR=1.37; 95%CI: 1.08-1.74).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third level 
  included religious practice and belief in God, of which only religious practice 
  maintained its significant association. Subjects who did not practice religion 
  reported 30% greater drug use than those who did (PR=1.31; 95%CI: 1.07-1.59).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data in the 
  present study were collected in both public and private schools, which allowed 
  for the inclusion of students belonging to different socioeconomic strata. The 
  study was based on a representative sample of adolescents attending urban schools 
  that provide <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i> education.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, one 
  must consider that the questionnaire employed, although widely used, is not 
  a validated instrument, since there is no gold standard for measuring this stigmatized 
  and illegal habit.<sup>5</sup> One must keep in mind, therefore, that this is 
  a study of drug-use reporting, and not of drug use itself. Such a limitation 
  is inherent to this type of study worldwide. As an attempt to overcome this 
  limitation, we employed a self-administered questionnaire, filled collectively 
  in the class room. This is an appropriate procedure for obtaining information 
  on private or illegal behaviors due to its confidential character and its ability 
  to ensure anonymity. In case of eventual information bias, it is reasonable 
  to assume that the tendency would be towards underreporting, given that this 
  information involves an illegal behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Returning to the 
  school in order to administer questionnaires to absent students is a differential 
  aspect of the present study in relation to most other studies with similar methodologies, 
  since it allowed for a reduction in the number of losses due to absences. The 
  absence of certain students during all visits may have been related to drug 
  use, thus generating a non-responder bias. However, total absences, refusals, 
  and annulled questionnaires did not exceed 8%, which allows us to consider that 
  our findings may be extrapolated to the population of adolescents that attended 
  schools with <i>ensino m&eacute;dio</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the data 
  in the present study refer to the population of adolescents that still attend 
  school, and thus cannot be generalized to dropouts or adolescents who have never 
  attended school. The problem of school dropout afflicts mainly low-income students, 
  as can be seen by the low representativity of these groups in student samples.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present analysis 
  investigates factors associated with drug use &#151; excluding alcohol and tobacco 
  &#151; in the year preceding the survey. For the sake of simplicity, such use 
  will be referred to simply as 'drug use'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drug use was more 
  frequent among the higher socioeconomic classes. Muza et al,<sup>10</sup> in 
  Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, Southeastern Brazil, found that the use of illicit substances 
  is greater among the wealthier class. Studies in other countries have shown 
  associations between money availability and drug use.<sup>12,16</sup> There 
  was a linear increase in the prevalence of drug use with age, but no significant 
  differences with respect to sex. Consumption differences between boys and girls 
  appear when different substances are evaluated in separate, but disappear when 
  drugs are grouped. We have considered the association between drug use and sociodemographic 
  factors in greater detail in a previous article.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study in Mexico 
  found that students who were drug users practiced sports less frequently than 
  nonusers.<sup>14</sup> This finding was not confirmed in the present study, 
  since neither practicing regular physical activity nor frequency of physical 
  activity were associated with drug use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Differences in 
  crude analysis showing greater drug use among subjects living in apartments 
  and with lower crowding rates (number of persons per bedroom) disappeared after 
  adjustment. These differences are likely to be related to socioeconomic issues, 
  since families of higher socioeconomic class have greater probability of living 
  in apartments and with less crowding. Flisher et al,<sup>7</sup> in South Africa, 
  also did not detect a significant association between drug use and crowding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, 
  the associations between a number of family characteristics and drug use persisted 
  after adjustment. The family plays an important role as a socializing agent 
  in the individual's life, and has thus been the subject of much interest in 
  studies investigating factors associated with drug use among adolescents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly, it is 
  important to emphasize the importance of parents' marital status. The children 
  of separated couples reported significantly greater drug use than those whose 
  parents lived together. A study conducted in Florian&oacute;polis,<sup>3</sup> 
  also in Southern Brazil, also found an association between drug use and parents' 
  divorce. However, the fact of parents not living together does not explain such 
  difference, since teenagers whose parents never lived together or those with 
  one or both parents dead did not show differences in drug use. Furthermore, 
  the present study design, in which exposure and outcome are measured simultaneously, 
  does not allow us to affirm that drug use occurred due to the divorce itself. 
  It is reasonable to speculate, therefore, that the effect is related to the 
  social aspects and emotional interactions into which divorce is inserted. The 
  emotional well-being of children may be affected by the conflicts and marital 
  unhappiness that usually precede divorce by a considerable period. We should 
  point out, however, that there was no relationship between drug use and parents' 
  divorce in the last year, which suggests an effect of post-divorce factors, 
  acting on a longer-term basis, such as estrangement from one or both parents, 
  economic difficulties, and changes of address, among others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another factor 
  studied was the relationship between adolescent and parents. Most subjects reported 
  a good or excellent relationship with their parents, although the proportion 
  of regular, poor, or very poor relationships with the father was higher than 
  with the mother. Less than 2% of subjects reported no contact with their mothers, 
  whereas lack of contact with the father was as high as 10%. More frequent drug 
  use occurs both among youths with poor or very poor relationships with mother 
  and with father, being roughly threefold higher among those with poor or very 
  poor relationships with their mothers. Studies conducted in other countries 
  found an association between drug use and a low level of satisfaction with the 
  support received from parents<sup>13</sup> and with a greater emotional distance 
  between youth and family.<sup>14</sup> The quality of the family relationship 
  has also been identified as a factor associated with drug use in a nationwide 
  sample of Brazilian students.<sup>5</sup> Poor relationship with parents may 
  predispose the youth to drug use, but drug use itself may bring about alterations 
  in behavior leading to difficulties in the youth-parent relationship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects who considered 
  their fathers as 'open-minded' also reported greater drug use than those who 
  considered their fathers as 'moderate' or 'authoritarian'. The way in which 
  freedom is granted is especially relevant in terms of the achievement of maturity. 
  Incomprehension and rejection are often masked by granting excessive freedom. 
  Such freedom is experienced by the adolescent as what it actually is, i.e., 
  abandonment.<sup>1</sup> A study conducted in Mexico found that a significantly 
  larger percentage of students who were not drug users reported that their parents 
  had clear rules regarding the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and considered 
  it important to follow parental advice and to obey the rules established.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects with other 
  drug users in the family also reported greater drug use. Drug and alcohol use 
  by parents were also identified as predictive factors in other studies.<sup>12,16</sup> 
  The fact of having a drug user at home may already be an indicator of family 
  disorders predisposing to drug use. Moreover, the greater proportion of addicts 
  in certain families may suggest an effect of genetic factors on modulating susceptibility 
  to addiction. On the other hand, when seeking to construct their own identities, 
  adolescents often adopt the models of behavior available to them, it being the 
  task of family and of educators in general to provide the adolescent with more 
  adequate models of behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drug use was also 
  higher among subjects who reported being victims of mistreatment. Carvalho et 
  al,<sup>6</sup> in a nationwide sample of students, identified domestic violence 
  as one of the factors related to drug use. The choice between substance use 
  as experimentation or on a regular basis is influenced by a number of factors, 
  present in the course of development, and is often related to reasons beyond 
  normal adolescence, being related to profound and early personal and familiar 
  disorders, into which familiar violence may be inserted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between drug use and the occurrence of mugging or theft again raises the issue 
  of study design and of the inability of cross-sectional designs to establish 
  a causal relationship between variables. If, on one hand, the stressful experience 
  of being the victim of mugging or theft may increase the adolescent's predisposition 
  to drug use, on the other, it may be related to the risk involved in the contact 
  with illegal drugs, since drug users are more exposed to the drug dealing environment 
  and its inherent violence, being thus more exposed to the occurrence of such 
  events. Regarding religion, we observed no differences in drug use between different 
  beliefs or when compared with the absence of religious belief. This may reflect 
  the fact that belonging to a given religion is probably merely a formality, 
  with no influence on behavior. The practice of religion itself was what determined 
  the difference, being associated with lesser drug use. Other studies have also 
  identified religious practice as a protective factor.<sup>12,16</sup> Aberastury 
  &amp; Knobel<sup>1</sup> report that it is during adolescence that one begins 
  to face the ultimate separation from ones parents, and the acceptation of the 
  possibility of their death, thus the need to identify with greatly idealized 
  images, able to ensure the continuity of existence. Greater religious involvement 
  may contribute to reinforce feelings of hope and security concerning the future, 
  rendering teenagers less inclined to become involved with substance abuse. Furthermore, 
  one must consider that religious practice may be a marker of behaviors assumed 
  by youths with a more conservative profile, who would also be less inclined 
  to become involved with risk behaviors, such as drug use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The drug issue 
  is quite a complex one, involving a large array of intervening factors. Epidemiological 
  studies shed some light on the understanding of this pathway, contributing towards 
  the advancement our knowledge of this reality. The results of the present study 
  contribute towards the identification of factors of the adolescent-family relationship 
  associated with drug use. Hence, the prevention of drug use by adolescents must 
  also include measures directed towards the family, especially in cases in which 
  risk situations have already been identified.</font></p>
