<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  describe epidemiological aspects of suicide mortality in a 10-year time series.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Suicide deaths reported in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), 
  Brazil, were put together as historical time series based on data from the Ministry 
  of Health Mortality Reporting System for the period 1980 to1999. Suicides were 
  grouped according to the WHO criteria and analyzed using standard demographic 
  variables.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Suicide rates (proportional mortality and mortality rates) in 
  RS during the study period were the highest in Brazil. The standardized rates 
  grew from around 9 per 100,000 in the 1980s to 11 per 100,000 in 1999. This 
  increase in mortality was attributed mainly to male mortality rates that grew 
  from 14 per 100,000 to the current 20 per 100,000. The male:female ratio increased 
  from 3 to 5. The highest ratios were seen among the elderly although this ratio 
  has been increasing in young adults as well. Widows, widowers and farmers/fishers 
  had the highest mortality rates.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The study highlights suicide as a collective health problem 
  in RS and shows aspects that could contribute to preventive action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suicide is a complex 
  phenomenon investigated in several scientific fields through complementary at 
  times antagonistic approaches. Psychiatry has generally considered suicide as 
  an individual phenomenon while social sciences, based on Durkheim<sup>6</sup> 
  (1982) classic descriptions, has regarded it as a collective behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers<sup>10</sup> 
  point out to the occurrence of suicide cultures where self-destructive behaviors 
  associated to the so-called "toxic existence" proliferate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last decades 
  scientific output on the subject of suicide has taken on a prevailing technical-realistic 
  approach. Following this path, the majority of studies have sought to identify 
  risk factors, which has implied in separating suicide into multiple variables 
  at biological, psychological, and social levels. Apparently, these studies have 
  not been able to produce any changes in the increasing suicide trends seen in 
  many countries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suicide could be 
  defined as a human act of interrupting one's own life.<sup>12</sup> By this 
  definition, it is implied that the term suicide can only be applicable in case 
  of death or in circumstances where the causal outcome is death and the agent 
  deliberately intended to produce death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Underreporting 
  of suicide mortality varies in different regions and cultures since suicide 
  is a taboo topic in most societies.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suicide-related 
  factors include previous attempts, affective disorders, social withdrawal, family 
  history, voicing of one's intentions and several demographic and socioeconomic 
  variables.<sup>22</sup> In Canada, risk groups for suicide comprise Native peoples, 
  youngsters, elderly, prisoners, homosexuals and individuals with family history 
  of suicide. To that it is associated cases of drug addiction, stressing life 
  events and terminal disease.<sup>24</sup> Five situations are currently described 
  as most relevant in suicidal behavior: 1) increase prevalence of depressive 
  disorders; 2) increasing abuse of psychoactive drugs; 3) psychobiological changes 
  such as early puberty; 4) increasing social stressors; 5) change in accepted 
  patterns of suicidal behavior and increasing availability of suicidal models.<sup>5</sup> 
  Mental disturbances and addictions co-occur in 90% of suicides reported in Europe 
  and the US.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers have 
  postulated the association between alcohol consumption and suicide based on 
  the assumption that suicide rates are inversely associated to social integration 
  and that alcohol abuse produces social disapproval and gradual deterioration 
  of social links. Besides the indirect association of alcohol consumption and 
  suicide through social disintegration, some researchers have pointed out a direct 
  relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide claiming that the individual's 
  reduced self-control would act as a trigger to a previous predisposition for 
  self-destructive behavior.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, though 
  underestimated, suicide deaths are low when compared to other deaths. But these 
  have increased mostly among male young adults. Mello Jorge<sup>16</sup> (2000) 
  seems it as concerning issue, especially because there were no methodological 
  changes in suicide reporting and data collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding socioeconomic 
  status, suicide is found among individuals at extremes: those less privileged 
  and those well-off.<sup>11</sup> Besides, a lowering in socioeconomic status 
  is also associated to suicide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Divorce, women 
  becoming part of the labor force, economical variables and unemployment were 
  also described as risk factors for suicide.<sup>3,14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rio Grande do Sul 
  (RS) is the Brazilian state that historically has showed the highest suicide 
  rates. This fact has been instigating investigators from different fields, especially 
  those working in social sciences and health. They have pointed out ethnic background 
  and culture, social instability, and even the local climate as potential intervening 
  factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  was designed to investigate high suicide mortality in some tobacco producing 
  regions of RS. This is part of a large ecological study, "Toxic agricultural 
  pesticides and other risk factors for suicide in RS," that aims at ascertaining 
  the association between exposure to toxic agricultural pesticides and suicide 
  mortality rates.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study aims 
  at describing epidemiological aspects of suicide in RS. A historical time series 
  was carried out from 1980 to 1999, highlighting descriptive aspects of suicide 
  found in death certificates.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A descriptive study 
  was carried out to describe aspects of suicide mortality in RS. Suicide mortality 
  rates and proportional mortality were obtained from statistical mortality data 
  of the Ministry of Health National Unified System Department of Information 
  Technology (Datasus).<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> Population 
  data were obtained from the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE) website.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> 
  Denominators used for estimating rates according to occupation were obtained 
  from the National Survey of Community-Dwelling Samples (PNAD-2001) data. They 
  were also used in estimating approximate rates as data were not available from 
  previous population censuses.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>***</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ninth Review 
  of International Disease Classification (IDC-9) &#151; three digits for the 
  period between 1980 and 1995 including coded categories between E950 and E959 
  &#151;, was used for estimating the number of suicides. The Tenth Review of 
  International Disease Classification (IDC-10) was used for the period between 
  1996 and 1999 including X60 to X84 and Y87 categories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historical time 
  series were created for the period 1980 to 1999. Rates were standardized based 
  on the standard population provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).<sup>1</sup> 
  The standard population comprises less children and more older adults aged more 
  than 70 years, thus balancing the excess weight given to children in a previous 
  estimate known as "Segi's standard population".<sup>1</sup> Creating a new standard 
  world population was needed mainly because of an increase in the old age group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data analysis was 
  conducted using the Ministry of Health TabWin software program.<sup>17</sup> 
  The following suicide mortality rates in RS were calculated: total mortality 
  rates according to sex, age group, occupation, schooling, marital status and 
  means of suicide. Schooling data were not presented here due to their low quality; 
  more than 50% were classified as "unknown". Linear regression analysis of standardized 
  mortality rates was carried out using Statistical Package of Social Sciences 
  (SPSS), version 10.0.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest suicide 
  rates were found in the southern region of Brazil, more specifically in RS (mean 
  of 10.2 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants for the period 1980 to 1999). During 
  the 20-year-period comprised in the study, the southern states of Santa Catarina 
  and Paran&aacute; had mean rates of 7.9 and 7.1 per 100,000, respectively, while 
  the national mean for the period was 4.3 deaths per 100,000. RS ranked first 
  in suicide mortality in all and every year comprised in the time series. Suicide 
  proportional mortality was also estimated for every Brazilian state as a way 
  of controlling for distortions caused by regional differences in the Mortality 
  Data System reliability. Similarly to mortality rates, suicide proportional 
  mortality in RS showed the highest rates in Brazil. It is worth noting that, 
  often seen as taboo, suicide deaths could be reported as an "unknown" external 
  cause of death leading to underreporting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_08t1.gif">Table 
  1</a> shows crude and standardized suicide mortality rates in RS in an historical 
  time series from 1980 to 1999. Standardized mortality rates for both sexes grew 
  from 9.5 in 1980 to 11.7 per 100,000 in 1999. There was an increase in standardized 
  rates for males from 14.0 in 1980 to 20.2 per 100,000 in 1999, while female 
  rates ranged from 3.2 to 4.7 per 100,000 in the same period. Male/female ratio 
  increased from 3 in 1980 to 5 per 100,000 by the end of the study period. The 
  temporal trend showed a sudden increase in 1983, an overall reduction between 
  1984 and 93 and a subsequent increase up to date.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regression lines 
  drew from standardized mortality rates revealed an ascending trend for suicide 
  among males and a slightly descending trend for suicide among females (<a href="#f1">Figure 
  1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rates according 
  to age groups had a gradual increase as age advanced (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>). 
  The highest rates were seen among elderly aged more than 70 years. However, 
  younger age groups showed increased rates in the recent years, mostly in the 
  last five years, which could indicate a trend toward juvenilization of suicide.</font></p>

  to marital status and occupation for the period between 1990 and 1998.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher suicide 
  rates were seen among married people but the highest rates were found among 
  widows. Separated and single people had the lowest rates. The risk almost tripled 
  among those working in farming and fishing activities, i. e., 16.3 per 100,000 
  compared to 5.7 per 100,000 among technical-scientific workforce. Rate standardization 
  in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_08t2.gif">Table 2</a> was not conducted because no census 
  data were available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most common 
  means of committing suicide was hanging (62.5%), followed by firearms (21.5%) 
  and unknown (6.9%) (<a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>). These three categories added 
  up to 90% of reported cases. It is worth stressing that the relative increase 
  of hanging and firearm use, as well as reduction of unknown means, could probably 
  indicate easier access to arms and improvement of the mortality data system. 
  Hanging was also the means of choice by farmers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RS showed the highest 
  suicide rates &#151; both mortality rates and proportional mortality &#151; 
  in Brazil during the study period. Mello Jorge<sup>16</sup> (2000) pointed out 
  that despite suicide mortality rates in Brazil are knowingly underestimated, 
  increasing rates are seen among young male adults. This is concerning since 
  this trend cannot be explained by any methodological changes in either reporting 
  or data collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An overview of 
  31 WHO countries<sup>4</sup> reporting suicide reveals varying suicide mortality 
  among countries and both high and low rates are seen in almost all continents 
  &#151; Americas, Asia, and Europe. According to mortality classification criteria, 
  rates below 5 per 100,000 are considered low; those ranging from 5 to 15 are 
  viewed as moderate; those between 15 and 30 as high, and those above 30, very 
  high.<sup>4</sup> By this classification, suicide mortality rates in RS can 
  be considered moderate in the general population but, among males, they are 
  classified as high with an increasing trend.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A well-documented 
  aspect of suicide epidemiology is male:female ratio, which is higher than 3:1 
  in many countries but has remained stable over the years in almost all countries 
  with available data. In the US, increasing financial, individual and social 
  opportunities for women were parallel to lower suicide rates.<sup>11</sup> In 
  India and China, women have high suicide risk.<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lower suicide rates 
  among women have been attributed to lower prevalence of alcohol dependence, 
  religiosity, and accommodating attitudes concerning their social aptitudes and 
  roles. Also, women generally manage to recognize early risks for depression, 
  suicide, and mental disease, and they are used to seeking help during crisis 
  and social support.<sup>23</sup> The fulfillment of maleness involves more suicide-prone 
  behaviors such as competitiveness, impulsiveness and easier access to lethal 
  weapon and fire arms. Failure to fulfill traditional male gender role, i. e., 
  being the family's financial provider, happens to a stressor for men. As part 
  of a patriarchal society, men are more susceptible to financial losses, such 
  as unemployment, impoverishment, and therefore more prone to suicide.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Individuals working 
  in farming and fishing sectors showed higher suicide mortality rates. In the 
  1990s, Brazil went through an economy crisis, which resulted in increasing unemployment 
  and shift of labor force to different working sectors. Suicide rates according 
  to occupation, using a constant denominator, could have been overestimated given 
  that there could have been a reduction in the total population working in the 
  farming sector recorded in the PNAD/2001. Even so, the authors opted for these 
  estimates because the proportional mortality found for those working in farming 
  came close to 30% of deaths and the estimation of rates, though approximate, 
  provides further epidemiological information on suicide in RS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being widowed can 
  be viewed as a life stressor and this life event is related to suicide in several 
  countries. Though it is often associated with age, the effect of both variables 
  &#151; being widowed and age &#151; could not be differentiated in the present 
  analysis. Correlations between suicide, divorce and/or separation have been 
  described by other authors.<sup>8</sup> There might be information bias regarding 
  marital status because higher rates were found among older people who are more 
  likely to become widowed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the 
  means of suicide, anthropological studies have showed the central role of hanging 
  in the ga&uacute;cho culture.<sup>13</sup> In fact, this means was used in more 
  than 60% of suicides. Leal<sup>13</sup> (1992) studied suicide from an anthropological 
  perspective as an event closely related to the patriarchal "ga&uacute;cho" (Latino 
  macho) culture. After investigating suicide in the German-descent rural community 
  of Santo Cristo (RS), Heck<sup>7</sup> (1994) concluded that settlers' problems 
  aggravated following the implementation of a new farming model in the 1970s 
  and 1980s. The advance of the capitalist production system in rural areas led 
  to leasing and loss of small lands and, consequently, mounting debts, land monopoly, 
  migration from rural areas to cities, disintegration of culture and moral values 
  and, ultimately, anomy. However, it is worth stressing the relative increase 
  in firearms use as a suicide means. Some authors have suggested the availability 
  of firearms at home as a precipitating situational factor of suicide.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suicide mortality 
  rates are known to increase with age but there has been a shift in age groups, 
  suggesting narrower life perspectives to younger populations. In several countries, 
  such as Canada, Sri Lanka, Austria, Finland and Switzerland, suicide among teenagers 
  and young adults has reached epidemic proportions.<sup>4</sup> Other countries, 
  such as Uruguay, in the Americas; Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka, in Asia; Austria, 
  Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary and Sweden, in Europe, have high 
  mortality rates among individuals older than 30 years.<sup>4</sup> By any means, 
  overall rates do not effectively indicate an older age group pattern; for instance, 
  in Finland, there has been described an epidemic pattern of suicide among teenagers 
  but moderate rates in the general population.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In RS, the highest 
  mortality rates according to age group are found among the elderly (older than 
  70 years). However, there has been an increasing trend among younger age groups, 
  20 to 59 years old, by the end of 1990s. This could be explained by the fact 
  that younger adults are more likely to get unemployed and suffer the effects 
  of the capitalist production system in rural areas. According to Mattoso<sup>15</sup> 
  (1999), "regardless of the methodology used, current unemployment rates are 
  unprecedented in Brazil". Using IBGE data, he stressed that unemployment rates 
  in six urban areas grew from 3.4% in 1989 to 7.6% in 1998. Thus, high unemployment 
  rates allied to economy instability could have contributed to an increase of 
  suicide mortality rates. Recent studies have depicted a different scenario from 
  that described by Durkheim<sup>6</sup> (1982) in the last century, when she 
  considered suicide part of a collective behavior, minimizing the burden of poverty 
  and underscoring social anomie as a triggering factor. According to Durkheim<sup>6</sup> 
  (1982), anomie reflects a circumstance where new values, habits and ways of 
  life are introduced in societies creating a void &#151; an anomic space &#151; 
  in which people are no longer able to exert any control on their peers, leaving 
  them unattended by themselves and more susceptible to suicide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nowadays, poverty 
  is regarded as a likely predisposing condition to suicide, which is associated 
  with unemployment, financial stress, and family instability.<sup>23</sup> Unemployment 
  can directly or indirectly impact on suicide mortality by producing higher levels 
  of anxiety in individuals facing layoffs. In contrast, emotionally compromised 
  individuals are the first to be laid off in times of economy recession<sup>23</sup> 
  and also higher suicide rates are found in unemployed individuals,<sup>3,5</sup> 
  especially in males who are more susceptible to financial adversities. Thus, 
  an increase in suicide rates could suggest an aggravation caused by economic 
  policies inflicted on working population, especially to those most susceptible 
  &#150;younger or older individuals, emotionally weakened and with poor job qualifications. 
  The RS has the highest suicide rates in Brazil especially among farmers because 
  the region was one of the first farming work fronts to be eliminated. When suicide 
  occurs mostly in an age, ethnic, or occupational group or in geographically 
  isolated groups, one should question whether this finding would be working as 
  a barometer of the pressure subjected to a society. High suicide mortality among 
  farmers could be reflecting these populations' poor living conditions &#151; 
  mounting debts, land monopoly, migration and anomie &#151; or severe occupational 
  exposure to toxic agricultural pesticides that could cause depression triggered 
  by neuroendocrine mechanisms.<sup>2,22 and 27</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suicide as an object 
  of theoretical thinking is an entity opposed to highly restrictive classifications. 
  Identification and follow-up of suicide events could bring significant insights 
  for its prevention in the general population.</font></p>
