<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  evaluate the influence of the consumption of cow's milk on the risk of anemia 
  during childhood in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>We have studied a probabilistic sample (n=584) of underfive 
  children living in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, between 
  1995 and 1996. Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11g/dl) was diagnosed using capillary 
  blood obtained by fingertip puncture. The cow's milk content and the density 
  of heme and nonheme iron in the child's diet were obtained using 24-hour recall 
  questionnaires. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to 
  study the association between cow's milk content in the diet and hemoglobin 
  concentration or risk of anemia, and included statistical control for potential 
  confounders (age, sex, birthweight, presence of intestinal parasites, family 
  income, and mother's schooling).<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>The prevalence of anemia was 45.2% and the mean contribution 
  of milk to the total caloric content of the children's diets was 22.0%. The 
  association between milk consumption and risk of anemia remained significant, 
  even after considering the dilutive effect of milk consumption on the density 
  of iron in the diet, thus indicating a possible inhibitor effect of milk on 
  the absorption of the iron present in the other foods ingested by the child.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The relative participation of cow's milk in the child's 
  diet showed a significant positive association with risk of anemia in children 
  between ages six and 60 months, regardless of the density of iron in the diet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anemia, an insufficient 
  concentration of hemoglobin in blood (&lt;11g/dl), is one of the most frequent 
  nutritional disorders worldwide.<sup>21</sup> Children under age five years 
  are second only to pregnant women in terms of anemia prevalence.<sup>14,21</sup> 
  According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, roughly one-half of 
  the underfives in developing countries &#151; China excluded &#151; suffer from 
  anemia. It is estimated that anemia affects 30% of preschool children in Latin 
  America.<sup>14</sup> A probabilistic household survey carried out in the city 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo found a 46.9% prevalence anemia in underfives.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a number 
  of factors may lead to anemia, including genetic problems (immunoglobulinopathies, 
  for instance) and parasitic infections (hookworms and other parasites), diets 
  with low iron content or which contain iron with low bioavailability are widely 
  acknowledged as the main cause for the high prevalence if this disease in childhood.<sup>13,14,20,21,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diets relying exceedingly 
  on the consumption of cow's milk may be one of the causes of the high risk of 
  anemia observed in the first years of life, since cow's milk is poor in iron 
  (about 2.6 mg Fe per 1,000 kcal). Recommended daily iron consumption between 
  ages six and 60 months is 10 mg, which corresponds to diets with iron densities 
  of 11.7 mg, 7.7 mg, and 5.6 mg for children aged six-11 months, 12-35 months, 
  and 36-60 months, respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  being poor in iron, cow's milk does not contain heme iron, the form which is 
  best absorbed by the body.<sup>3,13</sup> According to experimental data, cow's 
  milk also has the potential to inhibit the absorption of both heme and nonheme 
  iron present in other foods consumed by the child.<sup>4,5,17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notwithstanding, 
  the association between the consumption of cow's milk and hemoglobin concentration 
  has been little explored in epidemiological studies. A recent pioneer study 
  using a cohort of European children showed that the hemoglobin concentration 
  reached by children at age 12 months was inversely related to the number of 
  months during which the child consumed cow's milk.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  was designed to study the influence of cow's milk consumption on hemoglobin 
  concentrations and on the risk of anemia in underfives.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data used were 
  generated by a survey conducted by the <i>N&uacute;cleo de Pesquisas Epidemiol&oacute;gicas 
  em Nutri&ccedil;&atilde;o e Sa&uacute;de da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> 
  (Center for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health, University of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo &#151; NUPENS/USP), between September 1995 and September 1996, 
  based on a probabilistic sample composed of 4,560 households in the city of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo. This survey is known as the <i>Sa&uacute;de e Nutri&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  das Crian&ccedil;as de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> (Health and Nutrition in S&atilde;o 
  Paulo Children) survey. <sup>8</sup> Sampling was stratified and in multiple 
  stages, involving the random selection of census sectors, household clusters, 
  and individual households. Visits to the 4,560 selected households identified 
  1,390 children under age five years. Of these, 110 were not included in the 
  survey &#151; either because they were not found after three visits or because 
  parents did not authorize participation &#151; resulting in a total of 1,280 
  children aged between zero and 59 months. Dietary recalls investigating food 
  consumption in the last 24 hours were administered to all children aged between 
  six and 23 months, and to one of every three children aged between 24 and 59 
  months, totalling 598 children whose food consumption information are described 
  in the present study. Hemoglobin dosage could not be performed on 14 children, 
  and hence the analyses of the relationship between food consumption and hemoglobin 
  concentration refer to 584 children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on 
  food consumption was provided by the parent or caretaker by a 24-hour dietary 
  recall.<sup>22</sup> Blood samples were obtained by fingertip puncture, and 
  hemoglobin was measured at the child's home using a portable hemoglobinometer 
  (HemoCue<sup>&reg;</sup>)<sup>19</sup>. The information on salaries and other 
  sources of income and on maternal schooling used in the present study were obtained 
  by questionnaires. Information on the occurrence of intestinal parasitic diseases 
  was obtained from stool samples collected at the child's home and analysed by 
  sedimentation. The child's birthweight was obtained from maternity files, or, 
  alternatively, from information provided by the child's mother.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The level of cow's 
  milk consumption of each child was expressed as the percentage of the child's 
  daily calorie intake which was due to the consumption of any type of milk (whole-milk 
  or modified formula and natural, pasteurized, or long-life fluid milk). The 
  transformation of the foods reported in the 24-hour recall into energy and nutrients 
  was done using <i>Virtual Nutri<sup>&reg;</sup></i> software<i>.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a description 
  of the study population, we present the distribution of hemoglobin concentration, 
  anemia prevalence, and food consumption indicators according to sociodemographic 
  variables. The association with sex was evaluated by Student's <i>t</i> and 
  chi-squared tests. Associations with age (6-11, 12-23, 24-35, 36-47, and 48-60 
  months), per capita family income (0.0 <img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/07s1.gif" width="16" height="17" align="absmiddle">

  2.0, <u>&gt;</u>2.0 minimum wages) and mother's schooling ( 0-3, 4-7, 8-10, 
  <u>&gt;</u>11 years) was evaluated by simple linear regression and chi-squared 
  and linear trend tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The influence exerted 
  by the consumption of cow's milk on the iron density in the diet was studied 
  by comparing the observed value with the expected concentration if milk were 
  excluded and substituted by the remaining food items present in the child's 
  diet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The global effect 
  of the consumption of cow's milk on hemoglobin concentration was determined 
  based on a multiple regression model in which hemoglobin concentration was the 
  dependent variable and the relative consumption of cow's milk the explanatory 
  variable. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate influence over the 
  risk of anemia, with the child's anemia status (absent or present) as the outcome 
  and the terciles of relative milk consumption, expressed as the percentage contribution 
  of milk to the total calorie content of the diet, as the explanatory variable. 
  Child's birthweight, age, and sex, presence of intestinal parasitic disease, 
  per capita family income, and mother's schooling were considered as potential 
  confounders in the association between milk consumption and hemoglobin concentration 
  or anemia. Child's age and sex, per capita family income, and mother's schooling 
  were significantly associated with hemoglobin concentration and/or risk of anemia 
  in simple regression models (p&lt;0.05) and were included in the multiple regression 
  analysis. When measuring the specific effect of milk consumption on hemoglobin 
  concentration &#151; which would be independent of the 'diluting effect' of 
  milk on the density of iron in the diet &#151; heme- and nonheme-iron densities 
  were added to the regression models.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In all analyses, 
  weighting factors were employed in order to allow for the extrapolation of the 
  results obtained in the present study to the entire child population of the 
  city of S&atilde;o Paulo between ages six and 59 months. The <font face="Symbol">a</font>=5% 
  significance level was adopted. All analyses presented in the present study 
  were performed using STATA 6.0 software.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_07t1.gif">Table 
  1</a> presents the distribution of hemoglobin concentration and anemia in the 
  child population of S&atilde;o Paulo according to sociodemographic variables. 
  Anemia was present in 45.2% of children, and was significantly more prevalent 
  among boys than among girls. Anemia prevalence varies strongly with age, peaking 
  at some point between ages six and 12 months and declining slightly in the second 
  year of life and more sharply in the third year. Increases in both per capita 
  family income and mother's schooling were significantly associated with reductions 
  in the prevalence of anemia. Mean hemoglobin concentration is significantly 
  higher in girls than in boys, and tends to increase both with age and with family 
  income and mother's schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sociodemographic 
  distribution of the characteristics of the child's diet relevant to the present 
  study is presented in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_07t2.gif">Table 2</a>. The percentage 
  participation of milk in the diet decreases significantly with age, there being 
  no uniform pattern of variation along with family income and mother's schooling. 
  The indicators of iron density in the child's diet increased significantly with 
  age, per capita family income, and mother's schooling, with the exception of 
  nonheme iron, which did not differ significantly between the groups. There were 
  no significant differences between sexes with respect to milk consumption or 
  iron density indicators.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean iron density 
  in the milk consumed by the studied children (2.7 mg/1000 kcal) was lower than 
  the mean iron density in the children's diets (5.40 mg/1000 kcal). The 'diluting 
  effect' of milk on the iron density of the diet was estimated at 22%. This value 
  was obtained by comparing the iron density observed in the diet with the estimated 
  density in case milk were suppressed from the child's diet (5.40 mg/1000 kcal 
  in the first scenario vs. 6.17 mg/1000 kcal in the second).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_07t3.gif">Table 
  3</a> presents the results of linear regression between cow's milk consumption 
  and hemoglobin concentration. The percentage of the total daily calories ascribed 
  to milk was significantly correlated with the children's hemoglobin concentration 
  . However, this correlation was not independent of the density of heme and nonheme 
  iron in the diet. Note that the standardized regression coefficient between 
  milk consumption and hemoglobin concentration was only slightly altered after 
  controlling for the indicators of iron density in the diet. The result of controlled 
  Model C (0.0822) is quite similar to that of non-controlled Model B (0.1048). 
  This indicates that the negative effect of milk consumption on hemoglobin concentration 
  via an inhibition of iron absorption should not be disregarded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n6/en_07t4.gif">Table 
  4</a> presents the results of logistic regression models of the association 
  between terciles of relative milk consumption and risk of anemia. Positive associations 
  between these variables were obtained both in Model B (adjusted only for sex, 
  age, and socioeconomic variables), and in Model C (adjusted also for the iron 
  density of the diet). Model B shows that the odds ratio for anemia increased 
  by about 50% and 100% when children with intermediate (2<sup>nd</sup> tercile) 
  or high (3<sup>rd</sup> tercile) milk consumption, respectively, are compared 
  with children with low milk consumption (1<sup>st</sup> tercile). Controlling 
  for variations in the iron density of the diet has little effect on the excess 
  risk of anemia among children with higher milk consumption, which reinforces 
  the relevance of the mechanism of inhibition of iron absorption associated with 
  the consumption of cow's milk.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study we have shown that increases in the relative participation of cow's milk 
  in the child's diet are associated significantly and independently with increased 
  risk of anemia. This was based on a representative sample of the children living 
  in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo aged between six and 59 months, and on the collection 
  and analysis of information on the consumption of cow's milk, hemoglobin concentration, 
  and potential confounders. The association between milk consumption and risk 
  of anemia remained significant even after considering the dilutive effect of 
  milk consumption on the iron density of the diet, thus indicating a possible 
  inhibitive effect of milk on the absorption of the iron present in other foods 
  in the child's diet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although we acknowledged 
  that the instruments used for measuring food consumption (recall questionnaire) 
  and hemoglobin dosage (portable hemoglobinometer) may leave room for measurement 
  errors,<sup>10,22</sup> such errors are probably not associated, therefore leading 
  to an underestimation of the magnitude of the actual association between milk 
  consumption and anemia. It is also important to note that the evaluation of 
  the child's food consumption took place before the measurement of hemoglobin 
  concentration. Thus both the interviewer and the mother were unaware of child's 
  anemia status at the time the questionnaire was administered, reducing the risk 
  of systematic errors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The probabilistic 
  character and the successful implementation of the procedures employed for selecting 
  the original sample of the <i>Sa&uacute;de e Nutri&ccedil;&atilde;o das Crian&ccedil;as 
  de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> survey indicate that the results of the present study 
  may be extended to the entire child population of the city of S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, the magnitude 
  and distribution of anemia, and the child feeding patterns in the city of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo are similar to those found in other Brazilian urban centers, which could 
  favor a greater generalization of the results obtained in the present study. 
  A probabilistic household survey conducted in the city of Salvador, northeastern 
  Brazil, in 1996, found a 46.4% prevalence of anemia among underfives, a level 
  similar to the 45.2% found in S&atilde;o Paulo.<sup>6,9</sup> Still in the city 
  of Salvador, where food consumption in the last 24 hours was also studied, the 
  iron density in the diet was 5.6 mg/1,000 kcal in the six to 11 months age group 
  and 5.8 mg/1,000 kcal in the 12 to 23 months age group. Again, these values 
  were similar to those found in S&atilde;o Paulo, 5.0 mg/1,000 kcal and 5.4/1,000 
  kcal in these two age groups, respectively. An important participation of milk 
  in the diet was also observed in Salvador, where the participation of milk in 
  the total calorie value was 36.7% in the six to 11 months age group and 31.9% 
  in the 12 to 23 months group. The corresponding values in S&atilde;o Paulo were 
  31.7% and 26.9% in these two age groups, respectively.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three other probabilistic 
  surveys conducted in the 1990's in urban centers in the Northeast and South 
  Regions of Brazil showed prevalences of anemia in childhood very close to the 
  45.2% found in the present study: 39.6% in the metropolitan area of Recife, 
  Northeast Region, in 1997,<sup>16</sup> 47.8% in Porto Alegre, South Region, 
  in 1997 (children under age three years),<sup>18</sup> and 54.0% in Crici&uacute;ma, 
  also in the South Region, in 1996 (children under age three years).<sup>12</sup> 
  The age distribution of the prevalence of anemia &#151; peaking in the six to 
  24 month period and falling in older age groups &#151; observed in the S&atilde;o 
  Paulo study was also found in the above mentioned studies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Theoretically, 
  the negative influence of milk consumption on the hemoglobin concentration may 
  be due to two mechanisms: dilution and inhibition. The dilution mechanism is 
  related to the low concentration of iron present in cow's milk, whereas the 
  inhibition mechanism is related to the presence, in cow's milk, of substances 
  such as calcium, casein, and serum proteins, which are proven inhibitors of 
  iron absorption by the human organism.<sup>4,5,17</sup> Our results confirm 
  the importance of both mechanisms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another potential 
  mechanism for the negative influence of cow's milk on hemoglobin concentration 
  is the appearance of micro-hemorrhages in the intestinal mucosa, which would 
  be induced by the consumption of natural or pasteurized milk, but not by diluted 
  formula. Such micro-hemorrhages have been reported in the literature, particularly 
  among infants.<sup>1,15</sup> However, the inclusion, in our regression models, 
  of the type of milk ingested by the child did not indicate an association between 
  this variable and hemoglobin concentration, neither in the whole underfive sample, 
  nor among infants only (data not shown).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important 
  to note that the excessive consumption of non-modified cow's milk is not usually 
  mentioned as a relevant determinant of childhood anemia in national or international 
  publications on the subject.<sup>2,11,20,21</sup> A recent WHO publication, 
  however, recommends that the ingestion of milk not coincide with the child's 
  major meals.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned above, 
  due to the low precision of the instruments used for measuring food consumption 
  and hemoglobin concentration, the impact of milk consumption on the risk of 
  childhood anemia is likely to be higher than that observed. More precise regression 
  models &#151; based on the refinement of food consumption and hemoglobin concentration 
  measurement and possibly including the time intervals between major meals and 
  milk consumption &#151; would be required in order to better evaluate the potential 
  of orientations aimed at reducing (and/or better distributing throughout the 
  day) the relative consumption of milk to control anemia during childhood.</font></p>
