<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>Assuming 
  that ethnicity might be a basis for social differentiation and that such differences 
  might represent vulnerability to sickness, this study attempts to verify whether 
  race or ethnic origin have an effect on mortality patterns.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>The Sao Paulo State death register was examined from 1999 to 2001 in a contingence 
  table of causes according to the 10<sup>th</sup> ICD and race or skin-color 
  categories (White, Black, Mulatto and others). Chi-square test was used to check 
  the association between skin-color and cause of death; residual analysis was 
  used to elicit statistically significant excessive occurrences when each category 
  of cause of death and skin color was combined; and correspondence analysis was 
  used to examine overall relations among all categories considered.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>A total of 647,321 valid death registers were analyzed, among which 77.7% 
  were of Whites, 5.4% of Blacks, 14.3% of Mulattoes and 2.6% of others. A significant 
  association between skin color or race and cause of death was found. It may 
  be observed that, although Blacks and Mulattoes present a similar death profile, 
  on the contrary of Whites and others, which could be aggregated into a single 
  category, the former appear in distinct positions on the multidimensional map 
  presented. Except for mal defined causes, which characterize only the deaths 
  of Blacks, the other causes of death within this group are common to both Blacks 
  and Mulattoes, varying however, in intensity and as to the order in which they 
  appear death.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>Analysis of mortality according to race or color revealed that death has 
  a color. There is a White death, which has, among its causes, sicknesses, which, 
  although variable, are nothing more than sicknesses. There's a Black death, 
  which is not caused by sicknesses but by external causes, complications in labor 
  and delivery, mental disorders and ill- defined causes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a social 
  group is not defined by skin-color or race relations, ethnic differences are 
  associated with social inequities and affect people's ways of living.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2002, Batista,<sup>3</sup> 
  analyzed the results of the Research on Living Conditions (PCV-98) conducted 
  by the Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o SEADE &#91;State System of Data Analysis Foundation&#93; 
  in 1998 and found that it revealed significant differences between Black and 
  White families in the State of Sao Paulo. While the households of the latter 
  have two children, on the average, and the head of the household is a man, the 
  former tend to have a larger number of children and frequently have a female 
  head of the household. Black families tend to have less schooling and a lower 
  family income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This adversity, 
  revealed by the PCV-98, with respect to the living conditions of Blacks in the 
  State of Sao Paulo, only confirm results found in nationwide studies. In fact, 
  Soares,<sup>8</sup> in an analysis of the PNADs (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostras 
  de Domic&iacute;lios) &#91;National Household Sample Research&#93; 1987-98 undertaken 
  in 2000 for the IPEA (Instituto de Pesquisas Econ&ocirc;micas Avan&ccedil;adas) 
  &#91;Institute for Advanced Economic Research&#93;, indicates differences among White 
  and Black men with respect to wages and allocation in the labor market. Blacks 
  receive lower salaries, occupy worse functions and are engaged in less qualified 
  activities. In a similar manner, Henriques,<sup>5</sup> studied the evolution 
  of living conditions in the nineties and found that 63% of the poor population 
  is Black and that 61.2% of the Black population is poor or indigent. Thus, he 
  states, <i>"The unequivocal conclusion that presents itself is that being born 
  Mulatto or Black increases significantly the probability of a Brazilian being 
  poor."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to deal 
  with adverse life situations as social components of the health-sickness process, 
  Ayres<sup>1</sup> recuperates the concept of vulnerability which, like the epidemiological 
  concept of risk, attempts to measure objectively how individual or group characteristics 
  may imply in increased probabilities of becoming sick or in less opportunities 
  to protect oneself against sickness. Turner et al<sup>9</sup> define vulnerability 
  as the degree to which a system is inclined to experience harm from exposure 
  to an aggression, whether it be a commotion or a stress factor. According to 
  these authors, the usefulness of a vulnerability analysis increases, among other 
  factors, when it makes it easier to identify critical interactions in the human 
  - (social) environmental system, which suggest that decision makers have opportunities 
  to reply. Vulnerability is also a useful concept when the methodology employed 
  allows for the analysis of a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. 
  These two particular aspects of the concept of vulnerability guided the course 
  of analysis in this study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Death registers 
  in the last few years have been aggregating information on color/race (Black, 
  Mulatto, White, Yellow and Indigenous), based on the theoretical references 
  mentioned above, that is, on the premise that race/skin-color is a factor of 
  social differentiation and results in different vulnerabilities to sickness, 
  this study intends to verify if race/skin-color affects characteristic patterns 
  of mortality. That is, if death has a color.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Death registers 
  of the residents of Sao Paulo State from the year 1999 to 2001 were made available 
  by the Centro de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es de Sa&uacute;de da Secretaria de 
  Sa&uacute;de do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo (CIS-SES) &#91;Health Information Center 
  of the Sao Paulo State Health Department&#93;. Data concerning basic cause of death 
  were processed as proportional mortality according to the 10th ICD and organized 
  in categories of race/skin-color within a contingency table. Analysis of proportional 
  mortality was considered preferable to analysis of mortality coefficients so 
  as to limit investigation to death registers, without having to borrow denominators 
  from other sources of data in order to calculate coefficients. Furthermore, 
  the intention was to focus primarily on the associations between cause of death 
  and categories of skin-color/race. A qualitative approach was perhaps considered 
  more appropriate for the descriptive endeavor than quantitative tests utilized 
  to measure differences in mortality coefficients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Registers lacking 
  information on race/color were disregarded, as well as those in which the basic 
  cause of death was listed under chapter VII (Eye diseases and affections of 
  the ocular annexes - H00 a H59) or under chapter VIII (Diseases of the ear and 
  of the mastoid process - H60 a H95) of the 10<sup>th</sup> ICD. The former because 
  the cause/skin-color contingency was null and the latter because, the contingency, 
  although it was discernable, was practically null given the small number of 
  deaths due to these basic causes - 0.013% among the total number of registers 
  analyzed. The race/skin-color categories "yellow" and "indigenous" were aggregated, 
  forming the single category "others", which, even so, represented only 2.6% 
  of the total number of deaths analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis of the 
  contingency table was undertaken following Pereira's suggestions.<sup>7</sup> 
  Associations between the variables "basic cause' and 'skin-color/race' were 
  evaluated by means of the <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> test. Associations 
  between pairs of categories of these variables were then analyzed by means of 
  residual analysis and, finally, the relations between all the categories of 
  both variables were submitted to correspondence analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> 
  test makes it possible to discern whether deaths are distributed randomly according 
  to basic cause and skin-color/race or if there is a specific pattern determined 
  by dependence on these variables. Residual analysis reveals the characteristic 
  patterns displayed by each category of each variable according to excess or 
  lack of occurrences of combinations with each category of the other variable. 
  This study sought to characterize the categories race/skin-color according to 
  excess occurrences in combinations with categories of basic causes of death: 
  what were the most frequent and statistically significant causes of death among 
  people of a given race/skin-color? The level of significance employed was 5%, 
  both in associations between variables in the <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> 
  test and in associations between categories of variables in residual analysis. 
  This level of significance for excess occurrences corresponds to a residue with 
  a positive value greater than 1.96.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Correspondence 
  analysis is a technique of graphic representation, projected on a map, of the 
  multidimensional relations among the categories of the variables being studied 
  according to the <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> distances between 
  them. Symmetric projection was utilized, making it possible to examine the relations 
  between lines and columns of the contingency table simultaneously, that is, 
  the relations between all the categories of both variables under consideration. 
  Categories located near each other on the map are more closely associated than 
  those which are separated by greater distances. Any category, represented by 
  a point on the map, may be analyzed separately and characterized according to 
  its distance with respect to the projection of points representing all the other 
  categories on a straight line that connects its plotted point to the origin 
  of the axis on the map. When categories of the same variable are situated near 
  each other on a correspondence analysis map this indicates that, irrespective 
  of their semantic content, they may be considered equivalent with respect to 
  the distribution of masses of the total number of observations made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this study, 
  the yellow and indigenous color/race categories, irrespective of their distinct 
  ethnic significance, were aggregated under a single category "others" on the 
  basis of a preliminary analysis which indicated congruent projections on a correspondence 
  analysis map. When categories of two contingent variables are projected near 
  each other, this suggests an association between the events they represent, 
  although there is no implication with respect to statistical significance. Statistical 
  significance may be analyzed for pairs of categories in residual analysis, as 
  described beforehand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must be kept 
  in mind, for an adequate interpretation of the results, that correspondence 
  analysis is essentially descriptive in nature. Consequently, no inferences may 
  be derived with respect to cause and effect, nor can risk interpretations be 
  implied as a corollary. The Chi-square test and residual analysis measure the 
  distance between the observations made and those expected in a random distribution. 
  Correspondence analysis offers information regarding the contrasts between associations 
  among categories of contingent variables. A stronger relation between two categories 
  in comparison to other relations does not imply that the former will have effects 
  over the latter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the period 
  under investigation in this study (1999 to 2001), 647,321 valid registers were 
  obtained, being that 77.7% were Whites, 5.4% were Blacks, 14.3% were Mulattoes 
  and 2.6% were others. The proportion of registers lacking any written observation 
  with regard to race/skin-color decreases progressively throughout the period, 
  going from 13.6% in 1999, to 6.8% in 2000 and to 5.1% in 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contingency 
  between basic cause of death and race/skin-color (<a href="#tab1">Table1</a>), 
  submitted to the <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> test reveals that 
  these variables are not independent (p=0,000), that is, race/skin-color and 
  basic cause of death are not randomly combined. <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a> 
  presents the residual analysis which makes it possible to characterize the deaths 
  of each race/color according to its basic cause:</font></p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Correspondence 
  analysis derived two dimensions for projecting categories of variables. In conjunction, 
  these dimensions represented 99.4% of the variations of the original Chi-square 
  distances. The majority of the basic causes of death categories maintain small 
  distances among themselves, as if they were more or less equivalent, suggesting 
  that perhaps they could be united under a generic category held in common, such 
  as death due to disease. These causes form a cloud in the intermediary space 
  on the right hand side of the map (see the <a href="#fig1">Figure</a>), where 
  the categories race/skin-color 'White' and 'others' are also located. The proximity 
  between these two categories may also indicate that, instead of two there is 
  actually a single category of persons: non Blacks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="fig1"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21749f1.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside the cloud 
  of diseases <i>in general</i>, there are some basic causes of death that stand 
  out due to their specificities (isolated sites). These include causes such as 
  pregnancy and birth, mental disorders, infectious diseases, ill-defined causes, 
  endocrinological and nutritional disorders, external, congenital and perinatal 
  causes. These would be non banal causes that cannot be united into a single 
  category of deaths. Perhaps, they should be interpreted as the denial of the 
  former category, indicated by the cloud of causes on the east side of the map. 
  If the former is the category of deaths due to disease, perhaps these causes 
  should be considered the category of deaths not due to disease. In fact pregnancy 
  and birth, mental disorders, infectious diseases, ill-defined causes, nutritional 
  disorders and external causes should not be causes of death. Indeed it is strange 
  if not repugnant that theses diseases or disorders should bring about death. 
  This group of causes, with the exception of congenital diseases that are more 
  closely associated to the White category, are more closely associated to the 
  Black and Mulatto categories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the Black 
  and Mulatto categories, correspondence analysis aggregates important information, 
  which is not apparent in residual analysis that examines relations between pairs 
  of categories. Whereas Whites and Others could be united into a single category, 
  Blacks and Mulattoes are distinct and should remain separate even though they 
  have a similar profile. Except for ill-defined deaths that are characteristic 
  among Blacks only, the other causes of death in this group are common among 
  both Blacks and Mulattoes; however, they vary in the order and intensity with 
  which they occur. This may be clearly observed both in the distinct values of 
  standard residues and in the distinct lines of projection of the categories 
  of skin-color/race in correspondence analysis. The line of projection used to 
  represent Black skin-color is depicted on the map from its source to the point 
  that characterizes Black skin-color. Pregnancy and birth is the first category 
  of basic cause. The same exercise may be repeated imagining lines being projected 
  towards any categories of basic causes of death or of race and skin-color. The 
  differences between the results obtained by projecting lines to specific categories 
  on the map and the data obtained through residual analysis should be credited 
  to the distortions arising from the projection of an originally tetra-dimensional 
  space (the four categories of skin-color/race) on a two-dimensional map derived 
  from correspondence analysis. In this analysis, the space between the Black 
  and Mulatto categories is occupied by the basic causes of death common among 
  both of them.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies concerning 
  the influence of race on the organization of society were greatly stimulated 
  by social movements. In fact, skin-color and race became objects of investigation 
  when they were reified by the Black Power Movement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paradoxically, 
  however, the Black race and skin-color category, which represents nothing more 
  than an expression of what is defined ontologically by ethnicity, by the inheritance 
  of an African culture, in the present study results in distinct identities for 
  Blacks and Mulattoes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps this is 
  not contradictory. Ethnicity, as suggested by the studies discussed in the introduction, 
  is not, in and of itself, a risk factor. It is the adverse social situation 
  of a racial/ethnic group that engenders its vulnerability. Whereas Black and 
  White are indisputable categories of race and skin-color, Mulatto is a socially 
  defined category. Half White and Half Black, the Mulatto recognizes himself 
  as one or the other depending upon how his/her image is socially constructed. 
  The identity of the Mulatto depends upon the social environment in which he 
  lives more than on any form of cultural atavism. The distinction between Black 
  and Mulatto is social in nature, as is the vulnerability of both categories. 
  Therefore, if the process of health and sickness, and consequently, of death, 
  is also a social phenomenon, it should not be a surprise that the relations 
  between race/skin-color and death express themselves as socially defined categories, 
  that is, death is related to race/skin-color by means of its categories of social 
  expression; the death of Afro-Brazilian descendents expresses itself in Black 
  and Mulatto skin-colors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inclusion of data 
  on race/skin-color in the death registers in reply to demands made by the Black 
  Power Movement created an effective opportunity to characterize empirically 
  the theoretical concept of vulnerability as applied to this racial/ethnic group. 
  It is surprising that, by applying adequate methodological strategies to a simple 
  contingency table, it is possible to unravel what death according to race/skin- 
  color signifies in the State of Sao Paulo. All causes of death are present among 
  Whites, who are randomly visited by any fatal disease. However, this rapid glance 
  at the causes of death should not mislead the ill-advised: death's polymorphism 
  among Whites cannot be attributed to the greater number of deaths among Whites 
  because the standardized residues express the distance between the observed 
  and the expected number of deaths according to the marginal frequencies of basic 
  cause and race/skin-color.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blacks and Mulattoes 
  have a similar pattern of death, but differ from each other by the order and, 
  principally, by the intensity of how these causes of death organize themselves. 
  The specificity of death among Blacks has been demonstrated in several studies 
  on mortality in the past few years. Martins &amp; Tanaka,<sup>6</sup> in 2000, 
  identified higher rates of maternal mortality among Blacks. In 2001, Barbosa<sup>2</sup> 
  demonstrated that the coefficients of general mortality are higher among Blacks, 
  Cunha<sup>4</sup> found greater infant mortality and Werneck<sup>10</sup> greater 
  HIV-Aids mortality among Blacks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study's major 
  conclusion is that people's deaths differ according to their ethnic origins 
  and that these differences may be characterized. In the State of Sao Paulo, 
  during the period being investigated, the most ignominious deaths occurred, 
  for the most part, among Afro-Brazilian descendents - including both Blacks 
  and Mulattoes. It should be noted that 803 deaths due to pregnancy, birth and 
  puerperium occurred during the study period in this State. Although these represent 
  only 0.12% of the total number of deaths registered during this three-year period 
  (see <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), it is significant that these occurrences 
  are more concentrated among Afro-Brazilian descendents - including both Blacks 
  and Mulattoes (see <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). In fact, although, in absolute 
  terms, there are twice as many deaths due to pregnancy and birth among Whites 
  (526 Whites and 269 Blacks), there are four times the number of Whites than 
  Blacks among the total number of deaths registered (503,128 and 127,559 respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  analysis of the relation between skin-color/race and cause of death, it was 
  not possible to characterize the social and economic condition of the deceased. 
  It must be taken into consideration that an association between social insertion 
  and skin-color/race on the one hand, and, on the other, between cause of death 
  and social insertion is not improbable and that this variable would probably 
  be a confounding factor in the associations that were found. Perhaps the characteristic 
  of death is not color, but socioeconomic status. However, within the scope of 
  this study, it was found that an analysis of mortality in the State of Sao Paulo 
  according to race/skin-color, death has a color; causes of death vary according 
  to skin-color/race.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a White 
  death that is caused by disease. Different types of diseases or disorders cause 
  death, but they are no more than that, those things which struggle against health 
  until one day they overcome the latter and bring about an inexorable ending: 
  death puts an end to life. Whites die of expected causes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>There is, on 
  the other hand, a Black death which isn't due to any expected cause, be it a 
  disease or disorder. Blacks die of misfortune. It is a senseless death, which 
  plays with life events, such as pregnancy and birth. It is an insane form of 
  death, which alienates ones existence in mental disorders. It is the death of 
  a prey assaulted by infectious diseases or violence due to external causes. 
  It is a death without a cause, for it is ill-defined. Black death doesn't bring 
  life to an end, it undoes life, it is an insane Atropos that cuts life's thread 
  before Clotho can weave it or Lachesis can measure it. Black death is a wretched 
  death.</i></font></p>
