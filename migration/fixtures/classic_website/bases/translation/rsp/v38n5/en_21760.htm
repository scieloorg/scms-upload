<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the working 
  environment of the armed forces, extended working days, ergonomic problems and 
  exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents are common. These are well-known 
  occupational risk factors for health.<sup>18</sup> In the Navy, in particular, 
  long periods of exposure to heat or solar radiation during training or shipboard 
  activities,<sup>7</sup> exposure to dust and smoke of chemical origin in confined 
  environments,<sup>7,18</sup> and to asbestos fiber<sup>5</sup> have been described. 
  Social isolation is another occupational risk described among Navy servicemen, 
  particularly on combat training trips,<sup>8</sup> which may lead to changes 
  in lifestyle,<sup>6</sup> for example increased smoking and alcohol consumption.<sup>3,4</sup> 
  Consequently, high rates of hospitalization due to alcohol-related disturbances,<sup>8</sup> 
  increased numbers of premature deaths due to digestive tract diseases,<sup>3,5</sup> 
  violent deaths<sup>5</sup> and, most frequently, high mortality due to cirrhosis 
  of the liver<sup>5,13</sup> are seen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies carried 
  out in Europe and in the United States have found increased mortality among 
  servicemen due to digestive tract diseases in particular, in comparison with 
  the general population.<sup>2-5</sup> Preliminary findings from the Brazilian 
  Navy, using the same database as in the present study, revealed greater proportional 
  mortality due to digestive tract, genitourinary tract and nervous system diseases 
  than in the reference population.<sup>15</sup> These results motivated the continuation 
  of the analysis, to form the subject of the present study. In this study, the 
  diagnostic subcategories are detailed and also the differences in mortality 
  according to occupations, specifically, for digestive tract, genitourinary tract 
  and nervous system diseases.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was a proportional 
  mortality study of servicemen in the Brazilian Navy who died between January 
  1, 1991, and December 31, 1995. The deaths that form the study population occurred 
  among active, reserve and retired servicemen who were resident in Brazil and 
  abroad, of male gender and aged over 19 years. Women were excluded from the 
  study because they had only recently been admitted into the navy and only represented 
  3% of the personnel during the study period. The reference population considered 
  in the study was the total number of deaths among males in the State of Rio 
  de Janeiro that occurred during the same period. This area was chosen because 
  it is the location where the greatest proportion of Navy servicemen are based, 
  and because it presents a similar proportion of deaths recorded as having poorly-defined 
  causes. Further detailing of the procedures is described in the previous publication.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Death certificates 
  for the study population were obtained from the Navy's service for retired personnel 
  and dependants' pensions (Servi&ccedil;o de Inativos e Pensionistas da Marinha 
  - SIPM), which is the body responsible for certifying pensions for the families 
  of dead servicemen. Sociodemographic and occupational data on these individuals 
  was also collected from this entity, from the records of the length of service 
  required for, and the calculation of, indemnifications and pensions for eligible 
  family members. Other information, relating to the reference population, was 
  obtained from the mortality information system (Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  de Mortalidade - SIM) of the Ministry of Health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Death certificates 
  do not constitute an official registration of the cause of death. To verify 
  the degree of reliability of the diagnosis of the basic cause of death between 
  death certificates and declarations, the diagnoses of 106 records selected randomly 
  from among those that made up the study population were compared. Concordance 
  of 89.62% was estimated for groups of causes of death that were defined in accordance 
  with the International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-9), 
  with a weighted Kappa index of 0.61 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.51-0.72, 
  which was considered acceptable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The causes of death 
  that were of interest in the present study were digestive tract diseases (ICD-9: 
  520-579), genitourinary tract diseases (ICD-9: 580-629) and nervous system diseases 
  (ICD-9: 320-389), which were found to be associated with working in the navy 
  (Silva et al,<sup>15</sup> 1998). The covariables analysed were: age in years, 
  marital status (single, married, widowed or separated), place of residence (Rio 
  de Janeiro or elsewhere), rank (<i>enlisted men -</i> marine, sailor, sergeant, 
  non-commissioned officer; or <i>commissioned officers -</i> ensign, lieutenant, 
  lieutenant-captain, lieutenant-commander, commander, commodore and admiral) 
  and occupation. The occupation was assessed by forming occupational groups that 
  were defined according to the similarity of their activities: <i>combat and 
  arms -</i> handlers of submarine weapons and artillery, gunners, torpedomen, 
  minemen and infantry; <i>healthcare</i> - doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses 
  and x-ray technicians; <i>mechanical and metalworking</i> - machine and motor 
  operators, aircraft mechanics, craftsmen, metalworkers, boiler operators; c<i>ommunications 
  and electro-electronics</i> - ship-to-shore and internal communications, ship 
  signaling, sonar, radar and telegraphy operators, general electronic equipment 
  and aviation electronics operators, and electricians; <i>naval sciences and 
  administration</i> - navy staff officers, hydrographers, divers, superintendents, 
  administrators, accountants, secretaries, chaplains, storemen and musicians; 
  <i>maintenance and repairs</i> - building and fittings craftsmen, carpenters, 
  damage assessors, deck and aviation equipment handlers and repairers; <i>general 
  services</i> - master chefs, occupations related to orderliness and housekeeping, 
  hairdressing and cleaning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proportional 
  mortality was calculated in accordance with the covariables and each of the 
  groups of causes of death that were selected: digestive tract, genitourinary 
  tract and nervous system diseases. Within these groups, specific diseases were 
  analyzed, and those that presented sufficient numbers of cases were selected 
  for study in more detail. The proportional mortality was calculated by dividing 
  the number of deaths due to the cause of interest by the total deaths for the 
  same period. Associations were measured as raw proportional mortality ratios 
  and adjusted for age by an indirect method using the corresponding proportional 
  mortality for the population of the State of Rio de Janeiro. The statistical 
  significance of the proportional mortality ratios was evaluated using 95% confidence 
  intervals that were calculated by means of significance factors for the observed 
  values in relation to the expected values, for variables with Poisson's distribution. 
  Since occupational data were limited to the Navy population, the proportional 
  mortality ratio was utilized for estimating associations with occupation for 
  each of occupational groups, taking all the other groups as the reference. For 
  specific estimates of proportional mortality according to illness and occupational 
  group, the total deaths for each occupational group were taken as the denominator. 
  When applicable, adjustment for age was done via the direct Mantel-Haenszel 
  method, which considers the relative importance of different strata. For the 
  statistical inferences, 95% confidence intervals estimated via the Mantel Haenszel 
  method were utilized.<sup>16</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the study 
  period, 3,882 deaths were recorded. It was not possible to locate 319 death 
  certificates (8.0%), and seven individuals aged between 17 and 19 years were 
  excluded because of the lack of corresponding strata in the reference population. 
  The study population thus consisted of 3,556 deaths. The majority of these individuals 
  (60%) had died aged more than 59 years, were married (77%), were resident in 
  Rio de Janeiro (70%) and belonged to the ranks of enlisted men (79%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In <a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>, it can be seen that there was no statistically significant difference 
  between the observed and expected deaths for the group of digestive tract diseases 
  (age-adjusted proportional mortality rate, PMR<sub>adj</sub> =1.08; 95% CI: 
  0.93-1.23). Nonetheless, the greatest proportional mortality ratios were found 
  for alcohol-related liver diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =2.03; 95% CI: 1.26-3.00), 
  pancreatitis (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =2.03; 95% CI: 1.06-3.38) and digestive hemorrhage 
  (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =1.61; 95% CI: 1.10-2.23), respectively. Among the genitourinary 
  tract diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =1.45; 95% CI: 1.16-1.81), it was possible 
  to identify an excess of deaths due to chronic renal diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> 
  =2.82; 95% CI: 1.98-3.84) (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). With regard to nervous 
  system diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =1.36; 95% CI: 0.83-2.03), larger proportions 
  of deaths among servicemen than expected were observed, caused by Parkinson's 
  disease (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =3.00; 95% CI: 1.27-5.72) and degenerative brain 
  diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =2.88; 95% CI: 1.14-5.70) (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>). In general, it could be noted that the raw estimates did not differ 
  significantly from the age-adjusted estimates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The occupation-related 
  results (<a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>) showed that there were positive associations 
  between the occupations in the communications and electro-electronics group 
  and nervous system diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =2.28; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92), and 
  between the general services group and genitourinary diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> 
  =1.82; 95% CI: 1.10-3.03). It should be noted that there was threshold statistical 
  significance for the association between the occupations in the maintenance 
  and repairs group and digestive tract diseases (PMR<sub>adj</sub> =1.35; 95% 
  CI: 0.95-1.91). Detailed analysis of these specific occupational groups (<a href="#tab5">Table 
  5</a>) showed that the relative excess of deaths due to nervous system diseases 
  was related to greater proportional mortality among radar operators (PMR<sub>raw</sub> 
  =6.50; 95% CI: 1.43-29.56) and telegraphers (PMR<sub>raw</sub> =2.94; 95% CI: 
  0.80-10.80), which were both in the communications and electro-electronics group. 
  No other associations at a statistically significant level were found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data from this 
  study indicate that, among the digestive diseases, Brazilian Navy servicemen 
  presented increased proportional death due to alcohol-related liver diseases 
  (ICD-9: 571 (.0, .2)), pancreatitis (ICD-9: 577 (.0, .1, .8)) and digestive 
  hemorrhage (ICD-9: 578 (.0, .9)), in relation to the reference population. For 
  genitourinary tract diseases, they presented greater proportional death due 
  to chronic renal diseases (ICD-9: 585), while among the nervous system diseases 
  there were statistically significant associations only with cerebral degeneration 
  (ICD-9: 331 (.0, .7, .9)) and Parkinson's disease (ICD-9: 332 (.0, .1)), in 
  relation to the reference population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies on servicemen 
  from several armed services have made similar findings regarding mortality due 
  to digestive tract diseases.<sup>3,5</sup> In particular, increased risk of 
  death due to cirrhosis of the liver has been found,<sup>4</sup> which is related 
  to abusive consumption of alcohol.<sup>3,5,13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the greater 
  proportion of deaths due to genitourinary tract and nervous system diseases 
  estimated for Brazilian servicemen differs from the results found by other authors.<sup>2,5</sup> 
  For example, a higher estimate for the incidence of genitourinary diseases among 
  hospitalized servicemen has only been made in one study, which dealt with the 
  period following the Gulf War.<sup>9</sup> Greater mortality due to nervous 
  system diseases was observed only in the British army for soldiers who served 
  in desert areas, when compared with the British navy and air force.<sup>5</sup> 
  Other studies have reported high incidence of sick leave due to nervous system 
  diseases among boiler technicians in the American navy<sup>9</sup> and premature 
  deaths due to neuromotor diseases among servicemen.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was observed 
  that servicemen who were communications technicians, electricians, technicians 
  or operators of electronic equipment, carpenters, deck and aircraft equipment 
  operators, maintenance personnel in general, cooks, hairdressers, those responsible 
  for cleaning, orderliness and housekeeping services or musicians presented greater 
  proportional death due to nervous system, genitourinary tract and digestive 
  tract diseases than did the respective reference populations. There are only 
  a few studies on occupational factors relating to servicemen's health, but they 
  show that workers in the occupations of healthcare, general operations, naval 
  engineering, maintenance, repairs and services, including those that belong 
  to the marines, are at a greater risk of accidents and violent deaths, and infectious, 
  respiratory and mental diseases, which are common among those working on ships.<sup>6,7,9,10,17,18</sup> 
  Although some occupations are indicated as presenting greater risk, the causes 
  of death differ from those found for the Brazilian Navy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, a strong association between the occupations of the communications and 
  electro-electronics group and deaths due to nervous system diseases was noticeable, 
  especially in relation to the disease sub-categories of cerebral degeneration 
  and Parkinson's disease. It is plausible that some of these deaths in the navy 
  may be associated with the electromagnetic and microwave fields that are present 
  in these occupations, especially among radar operators. For the latter, nervous 
  system diseases were six times more frequent than in other occupations. Such 
  exposure has, for example, been found to present an association with Alzheimer's 
  disease and other neuromotor diseases among civilian workers who were operating 
  radio and television stations and electric energy plants, and repairing telephone 
  and electrical networks.<sup>14</sup> With regard to the effect of microwaves, 
  studies on American servicemen who served during the period of the Korean War 
  have presented data suggestive of a greater risk of nervous system diseases 
  in the occupations of operating and repairing electrical, electronic and communications 
  equipment.<sup>12</sup> Although there is no evidence regarding specific occupational 
  risk factors among servicemen in relation to nervous system diseases, other 
  types of exposure that are also common in the military working environment are 
  associated with neuropathies, such as exposure to various metallic compounds, 
  organochlorates, solvents and electromagnetic fields.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greater proportional 
  mortality due to genitourinary tract diseases, in which specific analysis of 
  occupations revealed greater risk for general services personnel in the Brazilian 
  Navy, differs from the majority of findings. Servicemen have generally presented 
  low estimates of mortality for this group of diseases.<sup>2,3,5</sup> The exception 
  to this is a study made among hospitalized Gulf War veterans, which showed a 
  slight increase in the incidence of such diseases.<sup>8</sup> A review of occupations 
  in relation to genitourinary tract diseases has shown that chronic kidney diseases 
  were the main causes of death for industrial workers.<sup>10</sup> In addition 
  to these findings, there are records of the occurrence of subclinical nephropathy 
  among workers exposed to nephrotoxic substances such as inorganic lead and mercury, 
  cadmium and solvents, especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons.<sup>11</sup> 
  Such occurrences support the hypothesis of an association between the types 
  of occupational exposure that are supposedly more common in the working environment 
  of the navy and renal diseases. Although the estimate for the association between 
  general services occupations and genitourinary diseases did not present great 
  magnitude and statistical significance, possibly due to the instability of the 
  small numbers, some of these deaths may have an occupational implication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some methodological 
  limitations must be considered in the present study. This was an exploratory 
  study, and it was only possible to compare occupational groups as approximations 
  for supposedly homogenous groups. Thus, specific exposure was not considered 
  since, within a single occupational group, the individuals could present distinctly 
  varying intensities and duration of exposure. Another limitation relates to 
  the measurement of effect and association: when proportional mortality and proportional 
  mortality ratios are utilized, the risk of death is not measured. The proportional 
  mortality ratio is affected by the pattern of deaths among the population, which 
  includes competing risks between the different causes of deaths and the age 
  and gender composition. Nonetheless, the adjustment for age enabled better comparability 
  with the reference population, especially because the servicemen reached greater 
  ages and presented greater relative excess of deaths due to chronic diseases. 
  It can furthermore be noted that the effect of healthy workers was minimized 
  in the present study, because all the deaths among servicemen on sick leave 
  or who retired due to health problems or due to length of service were included. 
  In other words, the complete population base and all of the deaths during the 
  period of the study were observed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although occupational 
  analysis was only done for occupations in the Navy, this procedure contributed 
  towards minimizing the bias resulting from differences in the quality of diagnosis, 
  measurement of exposure or healthy worker effect. The groups compared had the 
  same origin and therefore were subjected to the same selection and classification 
  criteria. In addition to this, it can be considered that the Navy population 
  forms an excellent database for epidemiological studies. This database contains 
  health and occupational information from the monitoring of servicemen's health 
  from when they join until they leave, as well as the continuation of attendance 
  for retired servicemen within the Navy's own healthcare services throughout 
  Brazil. This allows complete cohorts to be followed, even though much of this 
  information is not computerized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study has 
  shown the need for further investigations, with measurement of occupational 
  exposure that enables the identification of specific occupational risk factors 
  in order to prevent damage to health or early death.</font></p>
