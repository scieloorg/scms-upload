<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>Assessing 
  the validity of self-reported hypertension and its determinants among adults 
  living in the community was the objective of this study.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHOD: 
  </b>A simple random sample of residents in the city of Bambu&iacute;, State 
  of Minas Gerais, Brazil aged <u>&gt;</u>18 years was selected. Three blood pressure 
  measurements were performed in 970 inhabitants. Sensitivity, specificity as 
  well as positive and negative predictive values of self-reported hypertension 
  were assessed in relation to hypertension (mean blood pressure <u>&gt;</u>90 or <u>&gt;</u>140 
  mm Hg and/or present use of anti-hypertensive drugs).<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Sensibility and specificity of self-reported hypertension were 72.1% (95% 
  CI: 69.3-75.0) and 86.4% (95% CI: 84.3-88.6), respectively. Its prevalence was 
  27.2% (95% CI: 24.4-30.1), being reasonably similar to the prevalence of hypertension 
  (23.3%; 95% CI: 20.7-26.1%). The validity of self-reported hypertension was 
  higher among women, among individuals aged 40-59 and <u>&gt;</u>60 years, among those 
  who visited a doctor more recently (&lt; two years) and among those with higher 
  body mass index (<u>&gt;</u>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The results of this study show that self-reported hypertension 
  is an appropriate indicator of hypertension prevalence, even in a population 
  not living in a large urban center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cardiovascular 
  diseases are the leading causes of death in the Brazilian adult population, 
  and of hospital admissions through the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  (Brazilian Unified Healthcare System), besides delivery.<sup>10,11</sup> Major 
  causes of death among individuals over age 25 years include cerebrovascular 
  and ischemic diseases (98.2 and 91.5 per 100.000 population, respectively).<sup>10</sup> 
  The major cause of hospital admission is cardiac insufficiency, which accounts 
  for 35% of all hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases in the same 
  age group.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arterial hypertension 
  is the main modifiable risk factor for coronary disease, cerebrovascular diseases, 
  congestive cardiac insufficiency, and other cardiovascular diseases <sup>13</sup> 
  The adequate treatment of arterial hypertension significantly reduces cardiovascular 
  morbidity and mortality.<sup>4,12,15</sup> Thus, knowledge of the distribution 
  of hypertension among the population and the identification of vulnerable groups 
  are of great interest to public health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To determine the 
  prevalence of hypertension in the population is a complex task, which requires 
  not only the measurement of arterial pressure, but also the verification of 
  the use of medication for its control.<sup>18</sup> This has encouraged the 
  search for simple indicators, capable of being used in population-based studies. 
  The simplest indicator of arterial hypertension is self-reported morbidity. 
  Self-reported hypertension has been used in a number of health surveys, including 
  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), in the United 
  States,<sup>19</sup> and the <i>Pesquisa Nacional por Amostras de Domic&iacute;lio</i> 
  (National Household Sample Survey - PNAD 98), in Brazil.<sup>7</sup> In the 
  American survey, information was obtained by means of the following question: 
  "<i>Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you 
  had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?".</i> <sup>19</sup> In the 
  Brazilian survey, the question adopted was: "<i>Do you have hypertension (high 
  blood pressure)?".</i><sup>7</sup> The prevalence of self-reported hypertension 
  found in the United States was 27% among participants <u>&gt;</u>25 years old.<sup>20</sup> 
  In Brazil, the corresponding prevalence was 20%.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of different 
  efforts have been made in order to validate self-reported morbidity related 
  to arterial hypertension, as well as to discover its determinants. In the United 
  States, high sensitivity (71%), specificity (90%), and positive (72%) and negative 
  (89%) predictive values were found for the data collected in NHANES III.<sup>20</sup> 
  In this survey, validity varied with sex (greater among women), time since last 
  medical appointment (greater among those who had had medical appointments more 
  recently), and presence of overweight.<sup>20</sup> No similar studies have 
  been found in Brazil. A study conducted among the employees of a state bank 
  in Rio de Janeiro showed low sensitivity for self-reported arterial hypertension,<sup>3</sup> 
  ranging form 42 to 50%, depending on the group studied. In another study conducted 
  in the same city, an excellent reliability (Kappa =0.75) was found for the information 
  regarding the history of diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension among 
  participants of the baseline of the <i>Pr&oacute;-Sa&uacute;de</i> Survey cohort.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  is aimed at determining the validity of self-reported hypertension among the 
  participants of the Bambu&iacute; health survey. An additional aim is to verify 
  whether the validity of this indicator varies with sex, age group, schooling, 
  family income, time since last medical appointment, and body mass index.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Bambu&iacute; 
  Project' is a population-based study conducted in the town of same name, in 
  the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, with approximately 15,000 inhabitants. 
  This project comprises two components: (1) a health survey conducted in a sample 
  representative of the whole population; and (2) a cohort study, in which all 
  elderly inhabitants are included.<sup>8</sup> The present study is part of the 
  former.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complete census 
  of the town of Bambu&iacute; was carried out in November 1994 in order to identify 
  participants for the health survey. A simple probabilistic sample of 1,664 residents 
  aged five years or older was selected, without reposition. The following parameters 
  were used for calculating sample size: (a) size of the population =14,239; (b) 
  precision =0.025; (c) confidence interval =0.95; (d) characteristic prevalence 
  =0.50; and (e) losses =0.20. Of the residents included in the sample, 90.1% 
  were interviewed and 82.5% examined (physical measurements and laboratory exams). 
  The participants of the study, both those interviewed and those examined, were 
  similar to the town's population of same age group in all sociodemographic characteristics 
  analyzed: sex, age, marital status, family income, and schooling. Further details 
  can be found in Lima-Costa et al<sup>8</sup> (2000). The present survey included 
  all participants of the Bambu&iacute; health survey aged <u>&gt;</u>18 years whose 
  blood pressure had been measured.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dependent variable 
  in this study is arterial hypertension, as defined by Joint Committee on Detection, 
  Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V)<sup>17</sup> criteria 
  (1993), that is, diastolic pressure <u>&gt;</u>90 mmHg and/or systolic pressure 140 
  mmHg and/or current use of medication for arterial hypertension. Three measurements 
  were performed, the first of which was discarded. Arterial pressure was considered 
  as the arithmetic mean of the second and third measurements. Measurements were 
  taken with the subject seated, after a five-minute rest, and after at least 
  30 minutes without ingestion of caffeine and/or smoking. Medication use was 
  assessed at the subject's home, through an interview which included the verification 
  of the medication package.<sup>1,8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Self-reported arterial 
  pressure was determined using a Portuguese translation of the question from 
  NHANES III mentioned above:<sup>19</sup> <i>"Algum m&eacute;dico ou profissional 
  de sa&uacute;de j&aacute; disse que voc&ecirc; tinha press&atilde;o alta ou 
  hipertens&atilde;o arterial?".</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remaining exploratory 
  variables studied were sex, age group, schooling (in completed years), monthly 
  family income (in current Brazilian minimum wages), and time since last medical 
  appointment (in years), in addition to body mass index (BMI, measured as weight 
  (kg) /height (m)<sup>2</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews were 
  conducted at the subject's home, and were composed of pre-coded questions. Interviewers 
  were selected from among members of the community with at least 11 years of 
  schooling and were trained by the Project team. Health workers, also selected 
  from among the members of the community, were trained to perform the anthropometrical 
  and blood pressure measurements according to pre-established protocols. The 
  equipments used were the following: table sphygmomanometers - Tycos (5097-30, 
  USA), stethoscopes - Littman (Cardiology II, USA), and anthropometers and digital 
  scales - CMS Weighing Equipment Ltd. (UK). Data collection was carried out between 
  August and December 1996.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Validity was determined 
  based on four characteristics: sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive 
  predictive values. Sensitivity is the proportion of hypertensive subjects who 
  reported a prior diagnosis of hypertension. Specificity is the proportion of 
  normotensive subjects who reported not having previously been diagnosed as having 
  hypertension. The positive predictive value is the proportion of hypertensive 
  subjects among those who reported a prior diagnosis. The negative predictive 
  value is the proportion of normotensive subjects among those who reported never 
  having been diagnosed as having arterial hypertension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Multiple logistic 
  regression was carried out in order to determine the variables independently 
  associated with hypertension. The initial model included all sociodemographic 
  and anthropometric variables. Only variables which modified the magnitude of 
  the odds ratio of self-reported hypertension to hypertension in at least 10% 
  were maintained in the final model. Statistical analyses were performed using 
  Stata v. 7.0 software.<sup>16</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 1,086 participants 
  of the Bambu&iacute; health survey aged 18 years or older, 970 were included 
  in the present study (116 were excluded for lacking blood pressure measurements). 
  Global prevalences of self-reported hypertension and hypertension were 27.2% 
  (95% CI =24.4-30.1) and 23.3% (95% CI =20.7-26.1), respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sociodemographic 
  and other characteristics of the studied sample are presented in <a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>. The predominant groups in the sample were women (56.5%), young adults 
  (50.1% were in the 18-39 years age group), subjects with schooling <u>&gt;</u>8 years 
  (33.3%), with family income <u>&gt;</u>4 minimum wages (42.4%), who had had medical 
  appointments less than two years prior to the interview (76.6%), and with BMI 
  &gt;25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (54.9%).</font></p>

  2</a> presents the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive 
  values of self-reported hypertension in relation to hypertension as determined 
  by JNC V<sup>17</sup> criteria. Global sensitivity and positive predictive value 
  were 72.1% (95% CI =69.3-75.0) and 61.7% (95% CI =58.7-64.8), respectively. 
  Global specificity and negative predictive value were 86.4% (95% CI =84.3-88.6) 
  and 91.1% (95% CI =89.3-92.9), respectively. The sensitivity of self-reported 
  hypertension was greater in women than in men, in the 40-59 and <u>&gt;</u>60 
  years age groups in comparison with the younger population, in subjects who 
  had had medical appointments less than two years prior to the interview than 
  in those who had not, and in subjects with BMI <u>&gt;</u>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 
  in comparison with those with lower BMIs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final results 
  of the multivariate analysis of factors associated with hypertension are presented 
  in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21750t3.gif">Table 3</a>. Independent associations were 
  found for self-reported hypertension, age group (40-59 and <u>&gt;</u>60 years), 
  time since last medical appointment (&lt;2 years) and BMI (<u>&gt;</u>25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sensitivity 
  and specificity of self reported hypertension found in the present study are 
  very similar to those observed in the NHANES III survey, conducted in a representative 
  sample of the United States population.<sup>20</sup> Sensitivity and specificity 
  in that survey were 71% and 90%, respectively. In the present study, the corresponding 
  values were 72% and 86%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally speaking, 
  our results confirm prior observations regarding the greater validity of self-reported 
  hypertension among women, overweight individuals, and individuals with more 
  recent medical appointments.<sup>2,6,14,20</sup> Considering all variables studied, 
  the lowest sensitivity was found among subjects with less recent medical appointments. 
  Vargas et al<sup>20</sup> (1997), in face of similar results, called attention 
  to the possibility that part of this association be explained by the greater 
  probability of the healthcare user receiving medication against hypertension, 
  which is one of the parameters considered in the definition of arterial hypertension. 
  In the present study, 125 subjects (12.9%) were classified as hypertensive based 
  exclusively on the use of medication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same authors<sup>20</sup> 
  also point out that the greater validity of self-reported hypertension among 
  women may be due to the greater utilization of the healthcare system and to 
  overweight, both of which are more frequent among women. Our results support 
  this hypothesis. The multivariate analysis showed that the variable <i>sex</i>, 
  when included in the logistic model, did not alter the strength of the association 
  between self-reported hypertension and hypertension, whereas time since last 
  medical appointment and BMI modified the magnitude of this association in an 
  independent manner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior studies have 
  shown that the validity of self-reported hypertension is not influenced by age.<sup>9,20</sup> 
  Our results do not confirm these observations. Considering all characteristic 
  studied, the second lowest sensitivity was found among the younger age group 
  (18-39 years). This result cannot be due to confounding, since age modified 
  the magnitude of the association between self-reported hypertension and hypertension 
  regardless of sex, BMI, or use of healthcare services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior observations 
  have consistently shown that socioeconomic status does not affect the validity 
  of self-reported morbidity for hypertension, both among non-Hispanic black and 
  white Americans and among Mexican-Americans.<sup>20</sup> Our results support 
  these observations. The validity of self-reported hypertension was not modified 
  by family income or schooling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general, population-based 
  studies of the validity of self-reported hypertension that use measured blood 
  pressure as the gold standard are subject to classification bias due to the 
  tendency towards regression to the mean.<sup>20</sup> In the present study, 
  three blood-pressure measurements obtained on the same day were used, which 
  may have reduced the strength of the associations found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results presented 
  above show that self-reported hypertension is an appropriate indicator for arterial 
  hypertension, even in a population living outside large urban centers. The similarity 
  between the present results and those obtained in the NHANES III survey<sup>20</sup> 
  confirm the more universal character of the instrument used, given that the 
  two surveys were conducted in very different populations. Further investigations 
  in other populations from developing countries are required in order to confirm 
  or not the external validity of these findings.</font></p>
