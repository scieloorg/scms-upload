<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  validate different methods for estimating HIV/Aids patients' body fat: total 
  body skinfold thickness, central (trunk) skinfold thickness, peripheral (limb) 
  skinfold thickness, waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Dual-energy 
  X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography of the abdomen (CTA) were 
  used as the gold standard.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>An analysis was done on 15 adult HIV/AIDS patients (10 men and 5 women) 
  who were being treated at the AIDS Clinic at a public university hospital, S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, Brazil. Their total subcutaneous fat (TSF) was estimated from the sum 
  of the thicknesses of the biceps, triceps, subscapular, midaxillary, suprailiac, 
  abdominal and medial calf skinfolds. The central subcutaneous fat (CSF) was 
  estimated by summing the subscapular, axillary, suprailiac and abdominal skinfold 
  measurements. The peripheral subcutaneous fat (PSF) was estimated by summing 
  the biceps, triceps and medial calf skinfold measurements. These were compared 
  with DEXA. The WC, WHR and CSF were compared with CTA. In the statistical analysis, 
  the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Mann-Whitney test were utilized.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Individuals infected 
  with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS patients in this era of 
  highly active antiretroviral therapy may be affected by morphological and metabolic 
  alterations that lead to an increase in risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.<sup>4,12</sup> 
  Imaging methods such as whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Dexa) and 
  computed tomography of the abdomen (CTA) are considered to be good techniques 
  for measuring body fat mass<sup>15</sup> and, as such, they have been used in 
  studies on HIV/AIDS patients.<sup>2,3,14,16</sup> However, the costs of these 
  examinations are still very high in developing countries like Brazil (on average, 
  US$ 49.00 and US$ 173.00, respectively), thereby making research on this subject 
  difficult and often impossible. Faced with this situation, the alternative is 
  to utilize doubly indirect methods to estimate fat mass, such as summed skinfold 
  thickness and circumferences,<sup>7</sup> despite the possible variability between 
  evaluations.<sup>13</sup> The more accessible of these methods, such as the 
  total body skinfold thickness, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio have 
  already been used in research on HIV/ AIDS patients carried out in developed 
  countries,<sup>11,14,17</sup> but studies on this topic are scarce in Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the objective 
  of the present study was to validate the measurements of total body skinfold 
  thickness, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio as doubly indirect methods 
  for assessing the total fat of the trunk, abdomen, limbs and whole body among 
  Brazilian HIV/AIDS patients who were using highly-active antiretroviral therapy.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was a study 
  carried out at the AIDS Clinic, a healthcare unit linked to the Clinical Division 
  for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases at a public university hospital, S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, Brazil. This is located in the central region of the city of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo and has about 4,000 registered HIV/AIDS patients. It is considered to 
  be a reference center for multidisciplinary care of individuals living with 
  HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data collection 
  was performed between October 2001 and February 2002. The sample consisted of 
  fifteen adult HIV/AIDS patients, of whom ten were men and five were women. The 
  sample size<sup>10</sup> was estimated from the means of the correlation coefficients 
  (ranging from 0.75 to 0.97; mean =0.87) from previous studies for validating 
  estimates of body fat percentage, body fat mass or fat-free mass that compared 
  these with the values measured by Dexa.<sup>8,15,19-21</sup> The values <font face="Symbol">a</font>=5% 
  and <font face="Symbol">b</font>=20% were assumed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The individuals 
  were selected randomly, on the basis of consecutive sampling. This technique 
  consisted of interviewing individuals who fulfilled the selection criteria at 
  a specific point in time.<sup>10</sup> Thus, the first six individuals who arrived 
  for their periodic consultation with an infectious disease physician during 
  any of the attendance shifts of the service were approached and invited to participate 
  in the study. The individuals selected needed to have been undergoing highly 
  active antiretroviral therapy for at least three months in relation to the date 
  on which they entered the study. The exclusion criteria were the presence of 
  any active opportunistic infection that could influence the analysis of body 
  fat at the time of assessment; any surgical intervention such as liposculpture 
  or liposuction performed within three months prior to the assessment; presence 
  of any incapacitating illness that would hinder the measurements and examinations; 
  pregnancy; and, finally, current use of corticosteroids, anabolic steroids and 
  hormonal contraceptives, in view of the possible influence of these medications 
  on body fat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this study, 
  the gold standard method used for evaluating body fat was whole-body Dexa imaging,<sup>3</sup> 
  which assessed total fat, trunk fat and limb fat (arms and legs), in kilograms. 
  CTA was also used as a gold standard<sup>3</sup> for evaluating visceral, subcutaneous 
  and total abdominal fat in the L4-L5 plane, in square centimeters. The Dexa 
  and CTA examinations were carried out at the Institute of Radiology of Hospital 
  das Cl&iacute;nicas, University of S&atilde;o Paulo, by technicians who were 
  specifically trained for this study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the Dexa examination, 
  the Hologic QDR 4500 equipment was utilized (Hologic Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, 
  USA). Standard procedures were adopted for positioning the subjects while performing 
  the examination. Subjects were firstly asked to remove all metal objects and 
  their shoes, and were then positioned in dorsal decubitus, inside the machine. 
  The examination was performed by means of transversal sweeps from the head to 
  the feet, to obtain images that were processed through Hologic's specific software.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the CTA examination, 
  the CT Pace equipment was utilized (General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
  USA). Firstly, a scouting image of the lumbar region was obtained in order to 
  determine the location of the L4-L5 disc plane. Following this, the CTA image 
  in the L4-L5 plane was obtained at 120 kV, 200 mA and a thickness of 10 mm. 
  The field of view (FOV) needed to be such that it would allow the whole abdomen 
  wall to be viewed. The areas of visceral and subcutaneous fat were then determined 
  from this image, and also the sum of the visceral and subcutaneous fat, to give 
  the total for abdominal fat. To define the area of the visceral fat, a line 
  was traced out on the tomography image, by means of an electronic cursor, along 
  the transversalis fascia anteriorly and the fascia of the quadratus lumborum 
  musculature posteriorly, thus excluding the vertebral body. After delineating 
  this region, the tomography computer was programmed to calculate only the area 
  of the fat present in this region, with the determination of the minimum and 
  maximum attenuation coefficients that would correspond to fat. In this work, 
  coefficients of -250 to -50 Hounsfield units were adopted. Thus, the equipment 
  would exclude from the calculation any structures not formed by fat. Following 
  this, the area of subcutaneous fat was calculated by tracing out a line immediately 
  externally to the skin surrounding the whole abdominal circumference. At the 
  point where this line met the initial point of the tracing, it was made to pass 
  anteriorly to the plane of the abdominal wall musculature, thereby obtaining 
  a region that was external to the muscle plane and internal to the skin plane, 
  all around the abdominal circumference. Finally, the same procedure for excluding 
  non-fatty structures was repeated, by means of adopting the same limiting values 
  for the attenuation coefficients. The areas of visceral and subcutaneous fat 
  and the total fat were determined in square centimeters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The total subcutaneous 
  fat (TSF) was evaluated by summing skinfold measurements from the whole body, 
  in millimeters (mm), utilizing the thicknesses of the biceps, triceps, subscapular, 
  midaxillary, suprailiac, abdominal and medial calf skinfolds. The central region 
  (trunk) subcutaneous fat (CSF) was determined by summing thicknesses of the 
  subscapular, midaxillary, suprailiac and abdominal skinfold measurements. The 
  peripheral (limb) subcutaneous fat (PSF) was determined by summing the biceps, 
  triceps and medial calf skinfold measurements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the measurement 
  of the skinfolds, the standardization proposed by Guedes (1994)<sup>7</sup> 
  was followed:</font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
<ol>
  <li> The biceps 
    skinfold thickness was obtained along the longitudinal axis of the arm, on 
    its anterior face at the point of the greatest apparent circumference of the 
    belly of the biceps muscle. 
  <li> The triceps 
    skinfold thickness was obtained along the longitudinal axis of the arm, on 
    its posterior face, and its exact observation point was halfway between the 
    superolateral margin of the acromion and the olecranon. 
  <li> The subscapular 
    skinfold thickness was obtained obliquely to the longitudinal axis, following 
    the orientation of the costal arches, at a point located two centimeters below 
    the lower angle of the scapula.
  <li>The suprailiac 
    skinfold thickness was obtained obliquely, two centimeters above the anteroposterior 
    iliac crest, at the level of the anterior axillary line. 
  <li>The midaxillary 
    skinfold thickness was obtained obliquely, along the orientation of the intercostal 
    arches. Its location was the intersection point between the midaxillary line 
    and an imaginary horizontal line that passes through the xiphisternal junction. 
  <li> The abdominal 
    skinfold thickness was obtained along the longitudinal axis of the body, at 
    approximately two centimeters to the right of the lateral margin of the umbilicus. 
  <li>The medial calf 
    skinfold thickness was obtained with the individual seated, with the knee 
    flexed at 90º, ankle in anatomical position and unsupported foot. 
    This skinfold was taken along the longitudinal axis of the body, at the level 
    of the greatest circumference of the leg.
</ol>
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The skinfolds were 
  measured three times using Lange skinfold calipers with a constant pressure 
  of 10 g/mm<sup>3</sup> and precision of 1.00 mm. The average of these measurements 
  was adopted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To measure the 
  circumferences, the standardization proposed by Heyward &amp; Stolarczyk<sup>9</sup> 
  (2000) was followed. The waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between 
  the last costal arch and the iliac crest, while the hip circumference was measured 
  at the point of greatest posterior protuberance of the buttocks. The waist and 
  hip circumferences were measured to a precision of 0.1 cm, using a Sanny non-stretchable 
  anthropometric glass-fiber tape, and the average of two measurements was adopted. 
  The height and body weight were measured to a precision of 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, 
  respectively, utilizing a Filizola digital balance and an anthropometric tape 
  attached to the wall of the evaluation room. The weight measurements were made 
  once and the height measurements were made three times, adopting the average 
  value. All these measurements were made by a single physical education professional 
  who was experienced in the field of measurements and evaluations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data analysis was 
  done using the SPSS software, version 10.0. The Pearson correlation coefficient 
  (r) and partial correlation coefficients, adjusted for age, were calculated. 
  Age adjustment was done because age can influence both subcutaneous and visceral 
  body fat.<sup>13</sup> The goodness of fit to normal distribution was evaluated 
  using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The correlations were considered strong when 
  the values were greater than or equal to 0.80.<sup>13</sup> The means were compared 
  between men and women using the Mann-Whitney test.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study was 
  approved by the research ethics committee of the School of Public Health, University 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo, and by the research projects evaluation committee of Hospital 
  das Cl&iacute;nicas, School of Medicine, University of S&atilde;o Paulo. All 
  participants in the study agreed to their participation and signed an informed 
  consent statement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample. Most 
  of the individuals were more than 35 years old (60%), and the mean ages according 
  to gender were similar (men =37.5 years and women =35.8 years; p=0.953). The 
  mean length of time for which the patients had been undergoing highly-active 
  antiretroviral therapy was similar for men and women (respectively, 37.6 and 
  40.0 months; p=0.754). One man and one woman had CD4+ cell counts that were 
  lower than 200 cells per cubic millimeter. However, considering that no problem 
  was observed that could influence the body fat at the time of data collection, 
  it was decided to keep them in the analysis. It was seen that the men were taller 
  (p=0.001), but that the percentage of fat mass was higher in the women than 
  in the men (p=0.040). For the remainder of the variables, the means were similar 
  (p&gt;0.05 for all of them).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The patient population 
  that was followed at the AIDS Clinic of Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas, University 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo were mainly male homosexuals with a high level of schooling.<sup>6</sup> 
  Although recent data on the Brazilian HIV/AIDS epidemic show that heterosexuals 
  are now the most predominantly exposed group and that the level of schooling 
  of most people living with AIDS is low,<sup>1</sup> we believe that this does 
  not affect the validation of the methods carried out in the present survey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, examinations performed using Dexa and CTA were taken to be the gold standard 
  for comparisons with anthropometry. According to Lohman<sup>13</sup> (1992), 
  for predictive techniques to be valid, the correlation coefficient must be greater 
  than 0.80. In the present study, both whole-body subcutaneous fat and central 
  region subcutaneous fat measured by skinfold summation presented such correlation 
  with total fat and trunk fat measured using Dexa, regardless of age. This was 
  also found for peripheral subcutaneous fat measured by skinfold summation in 
  relation to limb fat measured via Dexa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One advantage of 
  skinfold summation is that it allows analysis of the fat according to body segments.<sup>9</sup> 
  Skinfold summation is already being utilized with this aim in studies among 
  HIV/AIDS patients in developed countries.<sup>5</sup> For this reason, skinfold 
  summation has an advantage over other methods like bioimpedance, since the latter 
  is inefficient in analyzing fat according to body segments.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are more 
  than 93 measuring points for skinfolds on the body.<sup>7</sup> In the present 
  study, skinfolds representative of TSF, CSF and PSF that are often utilized 
  in anthropometry studies were analyzed.<sup>7,9</sup> It was also decided that 
  skinfolds that were more accessible should be evaluated, given that the recruitment 
  of the sample took place among subjects who were attending their periodic consultation 
  with an infectious disease physician. Since they did not have prior notification, 
  they were not appropriately dressed (e.g. wearing shorts and T-shirt) for the 
  assessment of certain skinfolds such as the thigh skinfold.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, the waist circumference was correlated with subcutaneous fat and total 
  abdominal fat evaluated using CTA, regardless of age. On the other hand, the 
  waist-to-hip ratio and the sum of the skinfolds of the central region subcutaneous 
  fat had a lower, but still significant correlation with the measurements via 
  CTA. The correlation was only greater than 0.80 for total abdominal fat measured 
  using CTA, regardless of age. Previous studies using samples of American adult 
  men<sup>5</sup> and French adult men and women<sup>17</sup> have shown that 
  both the waist circumference and the waist-to-hip ratio are good methods for 
  estimating abdominal fat in HIV/AIDS patients. The waist-to-hip ratio is of 
  special interest because it shows up morphological alterations such as reduction 
  in the hip circumference accompanied by increase in the waist circumference. 
  However, caution must be taken, because the measurement of the hip circumference 
  presents greater potential for error.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another interesting 
  result was the high correlation between the CSF and total abdominal fat. This 
  shows that waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and central region subcutaneous 
  fat can be representative of total abdominal fat, including both visceral and 
  subcutaneous fat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  the results have shown that both the sum of skinfold thicknesses and body circumferences 
  are valid as doubly indirect methods for evaluating the distribution of total 
  and regional fat in HIV/AIDS patients. They are useful both in research and 
  for following up patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy at 
  healthcare services, whenever imaging equipment like Dexa or CTA is unavailable 
  for routine evaluation. However, it is important to emphasize that the choice 
  of doubly indirect measurement must be made in accordance with the type of fat 
  to be evaluated.</font></p>
