<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  detect the prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly residents of an 
  urban area.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>A sample of 327 elderly residents (60 years and older) of the city of Montes 
  Claros, in northern Minas Gerais, was selected by means of probabilistic sampling, 
  in multiple strata, within a homogeneous stratum. The sample unit was the home. 
  Mental disorders were determined by means of the Short Psychiatric Evaluation 
  Schedule (SPES). Univariate analysis was done via the chi-squared test and multivariate 
  analysis via logistical regression.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>The estimated prevalence of mental disorders was 29.3%. Their presence was 
  associated with female sex, number of illnesses, functional capacity and place 
  of residence (shantytown/non-shantytown).<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>Comparing the results with other community studies, the prevalence of mental 
  disorders among the elderly in the urban area of Montes Claros was high and 
  was associated with multiple illnesses, incapacity and poverty. This reality 
  is a matter for concern because of its impact on quality of life relating to 
  this population's health, and on healthcare services over the next few decades.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growth of the 
  elderly population is a worldwide phenomenon, and is especially affecting developing 
  countries.<sup>16,17,19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Demographic 
  Yearbook</i> of 1997 showed that Brazil has one of the biggest elderly populations 
  in the world. Over the next 20 years, the elderly population in Brazil may reach 
  over 30 million people and will represent almost 13% of the total population 
  at the end of this period.<sup>7,13,16,17,19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The explosive growth 
  in the size of the elderly population has caused an increase in the number of 
  people at risk of acquiring neurological and psychiatric diseases.<sup>3,12</sup> 
  Aging may result in the presence of a multiplicity of diseases, losses and incapacities 
  with consequent deterioration of health among the elderly.<sup>3,13-15</sup> 
  Various factors that are associated with aging may predispose towards the development 
  of mental disorders, especially dysthymic symptoms.<sup>3,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mental disorders 
  are common and correspond to 8% of diseases.<sup>8</sup> They were already being 
  described by Hypocrites in Ancient Greece.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Psychiatric syndromes 
  are frequent entities in geriatric psychiatry.<sup>17</sup> Approximately one 
  in every six elderly people in the community present a history of mental disease.<sup>19</sup> 
  Such syndromes constitute a serious clinical and public health problem, as well 
  as being associated with worse quality of life in relation to health.<sup>1,7,19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to previous 
  studies carried out in various countries, the presence of mental disorders ranges 
  from 3 to 52.2% and anxiety and, especially, depression are the most frequent 
  psychiatric disorders.<sup>2-6,9,11,16,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This home-based 
  inquiry had the objective of estimating the prevalence of mental disorders among 
  the elderly in an urban region, with the aim of contributing towards preventive 
  action and attendance for this population.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was a cross-sectional, 
  descriptive and analytical study carried out in the city of Montes Claros, State 
  of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The sample was selected by probabilistic sampling in 
  clusters, in several stages. The sample unit was the home (Ramos<sup>13</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample was 
  selected by means of data from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics 
  (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica - IBGE) that divides 
  the city of Montes Claros into 186 census sectors, divided into various groups. 
  The urban area consists of sectors of urban type 10 (non-special; non-shanty 
  town) and urban type 11 (subnormal; shanty town). Together, these two types 
  make up 167 sectors. From these, the sectors 23, 18, 88, 154, 106, 117, 21 and 
  125 (type 10) and sector 78 (type 11) were drawn randomly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delineation 
  of the sector drawn was handed over to the researchers in the form of a map 
  showing all the streets to be surveyed. The starting point for beginning the 
  interviews was a place where two streets crossed. The streets on the map were 
  visited until the desired number of interviews had been completed. These interviews 
  were done by means of a questionnaire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One researcher 
  would go along the right side of the street and another along the left side. 
  Of every two houses, the first one was drawn and this was repeated right along 
  the street and subsequently for each sector that had been drawn. If the address 
  drawn was an apartment block, all persons aged over 60 years were interviewed. 
  Commercial properties or establishments were excluded: when these were drawn, 
  the researcher would move on to the next residential property.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After applying 
  the questionnaire on one street, the researcher continued to the next street 
  by taking the first turning to the right. When this was not possible, a left 
  turn was made and the procedure continued until terminating the drawn sector 
  or completing the number of individuals determined for the survey. Persons included 
  in the survey who were not at home at the time of the interview were sought 
  out for interviewing on a further three occasions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interviews 
  were held in the mornings, afternoons or evenings on all days of the week. The 
  questionnaires applied were handed in on the same day or the day following the 
  interview.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seven interviewers 
  (all of them university students) were duly trained before the start of the 
  survey, for a pilot project. During this training, the objective of the study 
  was explained and the questionnaire utilized was discussed in detail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The instrument 
  utilized was a psychogeriatric screening questionnaire: the Brazilian version 
  of the Short Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule (SPES). The questionnaire forms 
  part of a multidimensional assessment of the elderly, the Brazilian OARS Multidimensional 
  Function Assessment Questionnaire (BOMFAQ), which is the Brazilian version of 
  the Older Americans' Resources and Services questionnaire (OARS).<sup>2,4,9,12-14</sup> 
  The SPES is a test of 15 simple questions that are objective, short and quickly 
  completed, requiring only seven minutes for their application. Each question 
  requires a yes or no response. The total score for the questionnaire is obtained 
  by summing the number of yes responses, thus giving a score of between 0 and 
  15. The questionnaire has been found to present sensitivity of 61%, specificity 
  of 89%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 66% and negative predictive value 
  (NPV) of 87%.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result from 
  the questionnaire was considered to be positive when the score was greater than 
  or equal to seven. The scores presented good performance as indicators of psychiatric 
  symptoms, although without giving diagnostic precision.<sup>4,10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following domains 
  of BOMFAQ were analyzed: sociodemographic data, functional capacity, physical 
  health, mental health by means of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), 
  and the SPES. Univariate analysis was done initially, using the chi-squared 
  test, between the result from the SPES screening (dependent variable) stating 
  from the cutoff point of seven, and each of the abovementioned other variables 
  (independent variables). The covariables that showed a significant association 
  (p&lt;0.05) with the dependent variable SPES in this first model were selected 
  for multivariate logistic regression analysis. Through logistic regression, 
  variables with p&gt;0.05 were then removed from subsequent models, one by one. 
  The exercise was repeated until finding the variables that had the greatest 
  influence on the result from the screening and which had statistical significance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This research was 
  approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of S&atilde;o Paulo, 
  Escola Paulista de Medicina, and by the Ethics Committee of the State University 
  of Montes Claros.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews were 
  held with 327 individuals aged 60 years or over. The sociodemographic and economic 
  characteristics of this population are presented in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. 
  Eleven persons refused to participate in the study.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proportion 
  of women with positive screening for mental disorders (76.5%), was greater than 
  for the men. Among all the women, 36.1% had a positive score, versus only 21.6% 
  of the men. The association was statistically significant (p=0.007).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greatest proportion 
  of the people interviewed was in the age range of 60 to 64 years (30.9%). Within 
  this age range, there were many individuals with alterations, although there 
  were greater numbers among the people aged 75 years and over. There was a large 
  proportion of old people aged 80 and over and also a larger proportion of persons 
  with alterations (39.6%) in this population. However, these differences did 
  not present statistical significance (p=0.292).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A marked difference 
  with statistically significant values (p=0.000) was detected in the analysis 
  of place of residence (sector). High rates of alterations were concentrated 
  among those living in the shantytown sector. Among the 21 elderly people in 
  the shanty town, 17 had an income of up to one minimum salary (80.9%), 15 had 
  three or more diseases (71.4%), 13 (61.9%) presented moderate to severe daily 
  difficulties and 14 (66.7%) were women. In the assessment of cognitive function 
  in the mental state examination (MMSE), 80.9% of these individuals had a score 
  of <u>&lt;</u>23.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The marital status 
  did not show statistical significance (p=0.319). The proportion of women among 
  the widowed, single and separated individuals was, respectively, 81.7, 80.6 
  and 71.4%. It was seen that married people tended to mention fewer mental disorders 
  than did people in the other categories. Such alterations were most frequent 
  among separated and divorced people (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="tab2"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21752t2.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The income presented 
  statistical significance (p=0.010). The great majority of the elderly people 
  had a per capita income of less than or equal to one minimum salary. Individuals 
  with lower income mentioned more mental disorders. In contrast, those who received 
  more than four minimum salaries reported fewer mental disorders (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was no statistically 
  significant difference between living alone or not (p=0.681) (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The schooling category 
  did not present statistical significance (p=0.138). However, the largest scores 
  from the screening questionnaire were concentrated among illiterate people and 
  those who were only able to read and write. The interviewees' schooling level 
  was low, with an average length of schooling of 2.46 years. It was observed 
  that, as the schooling increased, the number of people presenting alterations 
  decreased (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  physical health, a minority (18.9%) did not report any disease (<a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>). The most common disease was hypertension (187 persons, or 57.2% of the 
  total sample), followed by diabetes, affecting 10.7%; 22 individuals had suffered 
  a cerebrovascular event. The individuals with the largest numbers of diseases 
  were in the shantytown sector (71.4%). The numbers of diseases affecting individuals 
  showed high values of statistical significance (p=0.000). It was seen that healthy 
  individuals reported fewer mental disorders. Among those with three or more 
  diseases, the majority presented alterations according to the questionnaire 
  (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Functional capacity 
  was measured according to daily activity on the 15-task BOMFAQ scale and indicated 
  the need for assistance, or the presence or absence of difficulty in performing 
  such activities. Out of the 86 elderly people in the whole sample who presented 
  serious difficulties, 65.1% were women and 34.9% were men; the majority lived 
  in sector 88 (45.5%) and the shanty town sector (38.1%). The latter category 
  was shown to be a factor of high significance from a statistical point of view 
  (p=0.000), in relation to the presence of mental disorders. There was an evident 
  difference between people showing alterations according to the screening questionnaire 
  who did not have functional difficulties and those with moderate to serious 
  difficulty and a positive test for mental disease (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  cognitive function, measured by the MMSE, the majority of the individuals had 
  scores of less than or equal to 23 (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The relationship 
  with mental disorders was statistically significant and the proportion of these 
  disorders was greater among individuals presenting alterations according to 
  the MMSE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a positive 
  score in relation to mental health for 31.2% of the individuals. Most of these 
  persons presenting alterations were in sectors 88 (54.6%) and 78 (57.1%) (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  formula: <i>P = % positive X PPV + % negative (1-NPV)</i>, the prevalence of 
  individuals presenting alterations was 29.3%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Logistic regression 
  following univariate analysis of the data led to four variables remaining: sex, 
  number of diseases, functional capacity and place of residence (sector). These 
  four variables were each capable of significantly interfering individually in 
  the SPES scores.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study had 
  some limitations. It was a cross-sectional assessment, while certain psychiatric 
  diseases of old age have fluctuating courses with alterations in form over just 
  a few days or even several times on the same day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">False positives 
  and false negatives are a byproduct from utilizing questionnaires in epidemiological 
  research. Thus, the effect of such incorrect classifications must be taken into 
  account in the findings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is possible 
  that old people exaggerate or underestimate their symptoms, and they may express 
  these with more vehemence and thus be detected on a questionnaire that is filled 
  out by non-experts. There is also an interrelationship between physical and 
  mental diseases, since physical diseases are very prevalent in the geriatric 
  population. Thus, false positives may be associated with this problem, given 
  that the SPES has some questions that investigate physical symptoms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite this, Blay 
  et al<sup>4</sup> (1988) stated that the SPES presented good performance as 
  an indicator for the presence of psychiatric symptoms. Even without giving diagnostic 
  precision, it is a valuable instrument for the first screening of people with 
  possible mental disorders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was the first 
  home-based survey for investigating mental disorders among the elderly population 
  in Montes Claros. A prevalence of 29.3% was found, which is comparable to the 
  rates found by Bourget,<sup>5</sup> in S&atilde;o Paulo (36.1%); Blay et al,<sup>4</sup> 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo (30%); Almeida,<sup>3</sup> in Salvador (33%); Ramos et 
  al,<sup>13</sup> in S&atilde;o Paulo (27%); Coelho &amp; Ramos,<sup>6</sup> 
  in Fortaleza (26.4%); and Liu,<sup>11</sup> in China (26%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The frequency of 
  alterations in the shantytown sector was much greater (57.1%), which backs the 
  theory that the prevalence of mental disorders is higher in poorer and needier 
  areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The findings from 
  the present study resemble those of Bourget,<sup>5</sup> in S&atilde;o Paulo, 
  Coelho &amp; Ramos,<sup>6</sup> in Fortaleza, and Liu,<sup>11</sup> in China, 
  in which the data gathered showed a high prevalence of mental disorders among 
  the needy low-income population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profile of 
  the population studied mirrors those of the populations studied in S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, Fortaleza and China. In these different studies, the majority of the 
  participants were women: 69.1% in S&atilde;o Paulo, 66% in Fortaleza, 57% in 
  China. In the present study, women formed a large majority: 66.1%. Likewise, 
  a large proportion of the population was in the youngest age group considered: 
  40.1% between 65 and 69 years in the study by Bourget<sup>5</sup> and 53% between 
  60 and 69 years in Coelho &amp; Ramos,<sup>6</sup> while in the present study, 
  53.5% were under 69 years old, 30.3% were between 70 and 79 and around 16.2% 
  were over 80.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  illiteracy, 37.4% of those interviewed in the study by Bourget<sup>5</sup> were 
  illiterate. In the present work, this prevalence was 39.1%, whereas in the study 
  by Liu,<sup>11</sup> 67% were illiterate and 93% had had less than six years 
  of schooling. In the present study, 63.4% of the population interviewed said 
  they had had less than four years of schooling, while in Bourget,<sup>5</sup> 
  59% were in the same situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another matter 
  observed was in relation to housing and the habit of living alone or not. Most 
  of the interviewees did not live alone: most frequently, they lived in multigenerational 
  homes. Only 6.4% of the individuals studied lived alone, while 20.2% of the 
  old people lived in crowded homes. In the study by Bourget,<sup>5</sup> around 
  15.4% lived alone and 19.1% lived with more than five other people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another finding 
  to be analyzed is the per capita income. A majority of the population interviewed 
  (68.2%) was receiving less than one minimum salary per month. In Bourget,<sup>5</sup> 
  71% earned less than 100 reais.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  the number of diseases and the functional capacity, a majority of the elderly 
  people studied (53.5%) had two or more chronic diseases and required assistance 
  in three or more daily activities, measured as daily activity values (45.3%). 
  The S&atilde;o Paulo and Fortaleza studies showed similar tendencies: in S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, 44.7% of the individuals had two or more diseases and 34.8% required 
  assistance in three or more daily activities. In the study by Coelho &amp; Ramos,<sup>6</sup> 
  in Fortaleza, 92.4% of the individuals had more than one chronic disease and 
  46.8% needed assistance in more that three daily activities. In the study by 
  Liu,<sup>11</sup> 67.2% presented chronic diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  other studies, the elderly population with mental disorders is mostly female, 
  widowed, needy and living with children and grandchildren, and has many chronic 
  diseases and incapacities in relation to daily activities.<sup>2,3,5,6,10,11,13,15,16,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Old age is the 
  time in the cycle of life when biopsychosocial interactions are very much narrowed. 
  Disorders in one area sometimes increase the potential for limitations in other 
  areas.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a need 
  for professionals to be trained in order to face the multidimensional problem 
  of the growing geriatric population. There is also a need for the healthcare 
  system to go through a process of restructuring aimed at promoting the prevention, 
  early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and incapacities that are 
  associated with adulthood and especially with old age.</font></p>
