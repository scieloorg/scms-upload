<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  assess the impact of the <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> b (Hib) conjugate vaccine 
  in reducing the incidence of meningitis among children under five years old.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>A 'before-after' design was used to compare Hib meningitis incidence rates 
  in the pre-vaccine (July 1995 - June 1999) and post-vaccine (July 1999 - June 
  2001) periods in the state of Goi&aacute;s, central Brazil . Bacterial meningitis 
  case definition was based on World Health Organization criteria. Incidence rates 
  of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> and <i>N. meningitidis</i> were used for comparison 
  purposes. Chi-squared and Student's t tests were used for statistical analysis. 
  P-values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>979 children with acute bacterial meningitis were detected throughout the 
  entire period. The incidence rate of Hib meningitis decreased from 10.8 (x10<sup>5</sup>) 
  in the pre-vaccine period to 2.3 (x10<sup>5</sup>) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> year 
  post vaccination, leading to a risk reduction of 78%, targeted to the 7-23 months 
  age group (p&lt;0.05). A total of 65 cases of Hib meningitis were prevented. 
  An increase in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis was observed. Vaccine failure

  </b>This study showed that mass immunization with Hib conjugate vaccine brought 
  about an expressive decline in childhood Hib meningitis in Goi&aacute;s soon 
  after the first year. Notwithstanding, an enhancement of surveillance using 
  high-accuracy tools is essential to: (i) detect a possible reemergence of Hib; 
  (ii) identify vaccine failure, and (iii) monitor changes in the <i>H. influenzae</i>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acute bacterial 
  meningitides are an important cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood. 
  <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> b (Hib) is an etiological agent of acute meningitis 
  in a large proportion of countries in which the conjugate vaccine has not yet 
  been introduced. In these areas, Hib is among the three primary causes of death 
  in children under five years old.<sup>18</sup> In Latin America, the relevance 
  of Hib to meningitis has recently been highlighted in a systematic review of 
  laboratory surveillance data on <i>H. influenzae.</i><sup>1</sup> The expressive 
  impact of Hib vaccination on invasive diseases is well documented in industrialized 
  areas such as the United States and several European countries, and, more recently, 
  in certain regions of Latin America.<sup>9</sup> Despite its availability, the 
  conjugate vaccine has not yet been introduced in most developing countries, 
  especially Africa and Asia, and thus millions of children continue to lack protection 
  against Hib invasive diseases.<sup>5,17</sup> The uncertainty regarding local 
  incidence data, the high cost of the vaccine, and the lack of knowledge concerning 
  vaccine effectiveness in populations with different epidemiological and genetic 
  characteristics from those of developed countries have limited the incorporation 
  of the Hib vaccine in the immunization programs of most developing countries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In several industrialized 
  countries, efficient surveillance systems have allowed for the definition of 
  an epidemiological baseline, thus facilitating the monitoring of Hib meningitis, 
  in programmatic conditions, in order to guide future public health actions and 
  measures. In Latin America, Hib vaccination was first introduced in Uruguay 
  in 1994, which was followed by Costa Rica and Chile. Currently, the Hib vaccine 
  is part of the national immunization programs of almost all countries in this 
  region.<sup>17</sup> In Brazil, the role of Hib in invasive disease underfives 
  has been evaluated by independent retrospective studies, based on data from 
  hospitals and/or referral laboratories.<sup>6</sup> The Hib vaccine was incorporated 
  into the national immunization program (PNI) in mid 1999, and publications addressing 
  the impact of vaccination are still scarce.<sup>12,13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  is aimed at identifying the impact of Hib vaccination on the incidence of meningitides 
  among underfives in the State of Goi&aacute;s, in Central Brazil, two years 
  after the introduction of the conjugate vaccine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This investigation 
  included children between ages 24 and 59 months diagnosed with acute bacterial 
  meningitis between 1 July 1995 and 30 June 2001. In order to evaluate the effect 
  of Hib vaccination on the risk of acquiring meningitis, a 'before-after' design 
  was adopted. The period preceding vaccine implementation (July 1995-June 1999) 
  was considered as the pre-vaccine period and the subsequent period (July 1999-June 
  2001), as the post-vaccine period. The Hib conjugate vaccine with diphtheria 
  protein (CRM<sub>197</sub>; HibTITER<sup>&reg;</sup>; Wyeth<sup>&reg;</sup> 
  Lederle) was administered between July and November 1999. After this period, 
  the vaccine containing the Hib polysaccharide conjugate with tetanus toxoid 
  (PRP-T), produced by the Brazilian laboratory Biomanguinhos (<i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Oswaldo Cruz</i> - Brazilian Ministry of Health) was used. Children under age 
  12 months were given three doses of the vaccine (at ages two, four, and six 
  months) and those between 12 and 24 were given a single dose.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acute bacterial 
  meningitis was diagnosed based on the criteria established by the World Health 
  Organization (WHO)<sup>15,16</sup> and by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH). 
  Confirmed cases were defined by microbiological isolation or antigen detection 
  (latex agglutination or counterimmunoelectrophoresis) in cerebrospinal fluid 
  (CSF). For surveillance purposes, WHO recommends the inclusion of probable cases 
  of acute bacterial meningitis (pABM).<sup>15</sup> The definition of such cases 
  is based on clinical suspicion of meningitis associated with a turbid ("cloudy") 
  CSF and at least one of the following findings in the CSF: elevated protein 
  (&gt;100 mg/dl), decreased glucose (&lt;40 mg/dl), or leukocytosis (&gt;100 
  mg/dl) with &gt;80% neutrophils.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From July 1995 
  to April 2000 the completeness .hospital admission data on bacterial meningitis 
  was maximized by reconciling reports,<sup>11</sup> thus ensuring greater accuracy 
  of data. A single database was built by incorporating the data obtained from 
  different sources: the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, logbooks 
  of the state central reference laboratory and of pediatric hospitals, and death 
  certificate records. Entries were subsequently confirmed or excluded based on 
  additional information from patient records, according to the case definition 
  criteria described above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May 2000 an 
  active prospective populational surveillance system was implemented for the 
  detection of cases of acute bacterial meningitis among underfives in Goi&aacute;s 
  state capital Goi&acirc;nia, to which roughly 70% of all cases statewide are 
  referred. All pediatric hospitals in the city were included in the enhanced 
  surveillance. Demographical and clinical data were collected. The immunization 
  status of children, including dates and number of doses of Hib vaccine was obtained 
  from children's immunization cards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laboratory diagnosis 
  followed WHO recommendations.<sup>16</sup> CSF was streaked on chocolate agar 
  plates supplemented with factors X and V. Difco<sup>&reg;</sup> antisera were 
  used for serotyping <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> isolates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Incidence rates 
  were calculated based on populational estimates obtained from the Brazilian 
  Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Cases of meningitis due to <i>Streptococcus 
  pneumoniae</i> and <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> were used for comparison purposes. 
  The number of prevented cases per etiological agent in the first and second 
  years post-vaccine was estimated based on the cumulative incidence in the pre-vaccine 
  period. A modified version of the analytical graphic method used at the Centers 
  for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for notifiable diseases was 
  used to compare the number of cases of meningitis in the periods before and 
  after the implementation of Hib vaccination.<sup>3</sup> According to this method, 
  the number of cases of meningitis during the pre-vaccine period was considered 
  as the historic value (expected value), and was compared with the number of 
  cases in the first and second years after the introduction of the vaccine (observed 
  values). A bar chart was constructed using a vertical axis which crosses a horizontal 
  logarithmic axis at the unit (point 1). Results were presented in terms of a 
  ratio <i>r</i>, calculating the number of cases observed per etiological agent 
  over the arithmetic mean of the number of cases expected. Over the horizontal 
  axis, a horizontal bar was constructed for each etiological agent according 
  to the value of <i>r</i>. Hatched bars extend either to the right or to the 
  left of the vertical axis, depending on if the ratio was higher or lower than 
  the unit, respectively. Confidence intervals, based on the normal distribution 
  theory, were constructed for <i>r</i>, and the portion of the bar extending 
  beyond these confidence intervals is represented by a blank bar. The number 
  of cases exceeding the upper limit of the 95%CI was considered as the number 
  of 'excess' cases, whereas values below the lower limit were considered as 'decreases'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comparisons between 
  proportions were evaluated by <font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup> tests 
  and differences between means by Student's t test. P-values below 0.05 were 
  considered as statistically significant. Data analysis was carried out using 
  SPSS (v. 10.0.1) and Epi Info 6.04d software.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between July 1995 
  and June 2001, 979 cases of bacterial meningitis were detected in children aged 
  two to 59 months in the State of Goi&aacute;s, of which 752 were in the pre-vaccine 
  period and 227 in the post-vaccine period (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). There 
  were no statistically significant differences between age groups in the pre- 
  and post-vaccine periods. There was a greater proportion of male cases in both 
  periods (p&lt;0.05). The overall case fatality rate did not vary between the 
  two periods. However, <i>H. influenzae</i> was the main cause of death in the 
  pre-vaccine period, whereas no statistically significant differences were detected 
  in the post-vaccine period. There was a decrease in the proportion of cases 
  of meningitis caused by <i>H. influenzae</i>, from 25.8% in the pre-vaccine 
  period to 15.9% in the post-vaccine period (p&lt;0,05), especially in the seven 
  to 23 months age group (p&lt;0,01) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21754f1.gif">Figure 1</a>). 
  On the other hand, there was a significant increase in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> 
  cases, from 2.7% to 12.8%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The log scale bar 
  chart in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows that the number of cases of Hib 
  meningitis decreased 41% (expected 0.92 - observed 0.51) in the first 12 months 
  after the introduction of the vaccine and 69% (expected 0.92 - observed 0.23) 
  in the subsequent year. By contrast, the number of cases of meningitis caused 
  by <i>S. pneumoniae</i> increased 98% (expected 1.42 - observed 2.40) in the 
  first 12 months and 198% (expected 1.42 - observed 3.40) in the following year. 
  The number of cases of meningitis caused by <i>N. meningitidis</i> fell 53% 
  in the first post-vaccine period, and 33% in the second. The number of probable 
  cases of meningitis fell 39% in the first post-vaccine period and 53% in the 
  second.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A comparison of 
  incidence rates in the pre-vaccine (10.8x10<sup>5</sup>) and post-vaccine (2.3x10<sup>5</sup>) 
  periods shows a 78% reduction in the risk of Hib meningitis. There was a progressive 
  increase in the risk of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis, from 1.1x10<sup>5</sup> 
  in the pre-vaccine period to 2.6x10<sup>5</sup> in the first year and 3.6x10<sup>5</sup> 
  in the second year post-vaccine, a 227% increase. Furthermore, there was a reduction 
  of 50.8% in the risk of probable meningitides between the pre-vaccine period 
  and the second year post-vaccine. (from 24.8x10<sup>5</sup> to 12.2x10<sup>5</sup>) 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21754t2.gif">Table 2</a>). In the post vaccine period, 65 
  cases of Hib meningitis and 102 cases of probable bacterial meningitis were 
  prevented. Nineteen predicted cases of <i>N. meningitidis</i> failed to occur 
  and there were 19 excess cases of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21754t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seven cases of 
  meningitis caused by <i>H. influenzae</i> occurred in children who had received 
  at least one dose of the Hib vaccine. <i>H. influenzae</i> type "a" was detected 
  in three of these cases. Vaccine failure was observed in a single case. This 
  was a child over one year old, without chronic diseases or immunodeficiencies, 
  who had received three doses of the vaccine, and who presented with Hib meningitis 
  16 months after receiving the last dose of the vaccine.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  shows an important reduction in the number of cases of Hib meningitis after 
  the first year of anti-Hib vaccination. The reduction in the risk of meningitis 
  - 51% in the first year and 78% in the second year post-vaccine - was significantly 
  higher in the seven to 23 month age group, which is consistent with the protective 
  immune response acquired after the third dose (sixth month of life).<sup>8</sup> 
  A comparison of the risk of Hib meningitis before vaccination (10.8x10<sup>5</sup>) 
  and after the second year post-vaccine (2.3x10<sup>5</sup>) shows that this 
  risk was 4.7-fold greater in the former period. In Brazil, few publications 
  have measured the role of Hib as an etiological agent of meningitides in childhood 
  before the introduction of the conjugate vaccine. The risk of Hib meningitis 
  found for the pre-vaccine period was similar to that observed in Campinas, southeastern 
  Brazil (17x10<sup>5</sup>), and is comparable to those found in European countries 
  such as Austria, Spain, and England.<sup>9,14</sup> The impact of the Hib vaccination 
  has also been evaluated in other Brazilian regions. In Curitiba, southern Brazil, 
  the incidence of meningitis dropped from 35.5 to 9.7x10<sup>5</sup> (72% reduction), 
  one year after the introduction of the vaccine.<sup>13</sup> In Salvador, northeastern 
  Brazil, similar results were found (69% reduction) after the first year of vaccination.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a significant 
  reduction in the number of probable acute bacterial meningitis (pABM) cases 
  in the post-vaccine period, most likely due to the implementation of the surveillance 
  system as well as to the accuracy of diagnostic tests. We may thereby infer 
  that, in the pre-vaccine period, many of the cases labeled as 'probable' were 
  caused by Hib. However, high rates of probable cases still persist, which may 
  be explained by the practice of self-medication, including the use of antimicrobials.<sup>1</sup> 
  Considering that the sensitivity of the prospective surveillance component was 
  greater than that of the retrospective component, the incidence rate in the 
  pre-vaccine period was probably higher than that observed, and, therefore, vaccination 
  impact may have been underestimated. It is well established that the effectiveness 
  of vaccination also depends on vaccine coverage. In the state of Goi&aacute;s 
  vaccine coverage was 78% in the first year and 90% in the second year after 
  implementation<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> which may 
  have contributed towards the progressive reduction in the incidence of Hib meningitis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, we observed an increase in the incidence of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis 
  in the post vaccine period. Some investigators have raised the possibility that 
  other serotypes of <i>H. influenzae</i>, and even <i>S. pneumoniae</i> itself 
  may be occupying the ecologic niche left open by Hib.<sup>7</sup> Our results 
  show that the increase in the incidence of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis began 
  already two years before the introduction of the Hib vaccine. It is therefore 
  unlikely that the increase in pneumococcal meningitis has occurred as consequence 
  of the effect of Hib vaccination on the reduction of Hib nasopharyngeal carriage. 
  Such increase may be due to the diagnostic methods implemented after 1998. Only 
  the continuous and efficient surveillance of bacterial meningitides will be 
  able to provide evidence of the current increase of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> in 
  the etiology of bacterial meningitis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent studies 
  have documented the emergence of invasive diseases caused by non-<i>b</i> <i>H. 
  influenzae</i> as well as by the unencapsulated strains, and even the reemergence 
  of Hib, causing concern among researchers in regions where the vaccine has been 
  introduced over a decade ago.<sup>4</sup> In Brazil, the appearance of serotype 
  <i>a</i> after the introduction of Hib vaccination has recently been documented.<sup>12</sup> 
  In the United Kingdom, the combination of Hib and acellular diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis 
  vaccine and the use of a accelerated scheme, with one-month intervals between 
  doses and without a booster dose, are among the hypotheses proposed to explain 
  the reemergence of Hib in the UK in the last four years.<sup>10</sup> The vaccination 
  schedule adopted in Brazil does not include a booster dose after 12 months, 
  which should be taken into consideration by the surveillance system in order 
  to monitor a possible reemergence of Hib. These findings reinforce the need 
  for maintaining an efficient surveillance system in the post-vaccine period, 
  since a new epidemiological scenario of invasive diseases due to <i>H. influenzae</i> 
  has been revealed, thus requiring the definition of new laboratory strategies 
  for the detection and serotyping of <i>H. influenzae</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The potential limitations 
  of surveillance systems have recently been underscored. In this sense, when 
  evaluating the incidence of meningitis after routine vaccination, the sensitivity 
  and specificity of the clinical definition of cases and of laboratory tests 
  is crucial. If the specificity of case definition is low, when the actual incidence 
  decreases, the predictive value of diagnostic tests also decreases, and the 
  proportion of false-positive <i>H. influenzae</i> diagnoses increases. Furthermore, 
  a recent study<sup>2</sup> of <i>H. influenzae</i> isolates obtained from different 
  Brazilian regions showed discordant results between routine serotyping (latex 
  agglutination) and the PCR technique, considered as the gold standard. The results 
  of this study ratify the need for a reevaluation of the laboratory procedure 
  protocols used in <i>H. influenzae</i> serotyping. Correct identification of 
  <i>H. influenzae</i> is essential in order do minimize biases when monitoring 
  alterations in the incidence of invasive Hib infections in the post-vaccine 
  period and when estimating the long-term impact of Hib vaccination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  evaluated the effectiveness of Hib vaccination in the state of Goi&aacute;s, 
  in central Brazil, detecting a significant impact on meningitis. Active continuous 
  surveillance is now needed in order to monitor changes in the epidemiological 
  pattern of meningitides and a possible reemergence of Hib. An increase in the 
  mean age of cases of Hib meningitis may occur, so new strategies for control 
  should be adopted. Surveillance will also be useful in detecting decreases in 
  vaccine coverage and cases of vaccine failure, with implications on the need 
  for a booster dose after the child's first year of life. Cases of meningitis 
  caused by non-<i>b</i> or by unencapsulated strains of <i>H. influenzae</i>, 
  along with alterations in the incidence of pneumococci and meningococci must 
  also be monitored. Finally, an efficient surveillance system will also provide 
  an epidemiological baseline for the evaluation of the impact of conjugate vaccines 
  against <i>S. pneumoniae</i> and <i>N. meningitidis</i> C.</font></p>
