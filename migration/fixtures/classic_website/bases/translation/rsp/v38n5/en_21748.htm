<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  study the susceptibility status of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> to the organophosphate 
  insecticide temephos.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Samples of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae were obtained, using ovitraps, 
  from eight cities of the Federal District, central Brazil, in 2000 and 2001. 
  Larvae were submitted to the diagnostic dose of 0.012 mg/l temephos, as recommended 
  by standard World Health Organization methodology. Field populations were tested 
  in parallel with reference strains Rockefeller and DIVAL, from the Environmental 
  Surveillance Directory (DIVAL) insectary. The concentration and purity of temephos 
  solutions were verified by gas chromatography. Correlation calculations were 
  performed using StatView - SAS Institute Inc., version 5. Student's <i>t</i> 
  test was used for detecting differences in susceptibility, with significance 
  levels of <font face="Symbol">a</font>=0.05.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>In 2000, <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae populations from Taguatinga, 
  Guar&aacute;, and N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante showed resistance to temephos, with 
  mortality ranging from 54.1 to 63.4%. The populations from Gama, Planaltina, 
  and Sobradinho showed altered levels of susceptibility (mortality ranging from 
  83.6 to 92.8%). The population from Ceil&acirc;ndia was the only susceptible 
  one, with 98% mortality. In 2001, all populations tested were resistant (44.4 
  to 66.4% mortality). No significant correlation was found between the susceptibility 
  of populations and the distance between the cities of origin, or the amount 
  of insecticide applied in the years preceding the study.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:<i> </i></b><i>Ae. aegypti</i> susceptibility to temephos is 
  changing in the Federal District. It is essential to continue monitoring the 
  resistance of this vector to insecticides in order to ensure the efficiency 
  of programs aimed at vector control and at the protection of human health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mosquito-transmitted 
  diseases are responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality in Brazil. 
  Dengue incidence rates in the last years show an increasing trend. In 2002, 
  672,371 cases of classical dengue and 2,090 cases of hemorrhagic dengue, of 
  which 96 ended in death, were reported countrywide.<sup>5</sup> Brazil has the 
  largest area of occurrence and transmission of yellow fever in the world, which 
  favors the occurrence of epidemics, and increases the risk of urbanization of 
  this disease.<sup>6</sup> The vectors of urban yellow fever and dengue are mosquitoes 
  of the <i>Aedes</i> genus, the most important species of which is the <i>Aedes</i> 
  (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>aegypti</i> (Linn&eacute;, 1762).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first foci 
  of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> in the Federal District, central Brazil, were identified 
  in 1985 and 1986. However, the mosquito established itself in the region only 
  in 1994.<sup>17</sup> The first autochthonous dengue cases appeared in 1997, 
  when five cases were notified. Since then, dengue incidence has been on the 
  rise. In 2002, 6,698 cases of the disease were notified, of which 1,463 were 
  autochthonous.<sup>4,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main strategy 
  for controlling <i>Ae. aegypti</i> in Brazil has been the intensive use of insecticides. 
  In the Federal District, the consumption of the organophosphate insecticide 
  temephos, used in the control of larvae, has been increasing progressively in 
  the last years. Internal reports of the Environmental Surveillance Directory 
  (DIVAL, unpublished) show that, of the 33,833 kg of temephos used between 1997 
  and 2001, approximately 60% were used in the last year alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The frequent use 
  of insecticides may lead to the development of mosquitoes resistant to these 
  compounds, hampering control and favoring the transmission of diseases. The 
  number of cases of insecticide resistance is increasing in certain Asian, Caribbean, 
  and Central and South American countries.<sup>14</sup> In Brazil, studies of 
  the resistance of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to insecticides have been conducted in 
  the states of S&atilde;o Paulo, Goi&aacute;s, and Mato Grosso do Sul.<sup>10,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study we evaluate the resistance of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations in the Federal 
  District to the organophosphate insecticide temephos.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Samples of mosquito 
  populations were obtained from eggs collected in ovitraps.<sup>9</sup> Eggs 
  were collected in randomly selected residences in the urban area of eight Federal 
  District cities (<a href="#fig1">Figure</a>), in 2000 and 2001. Ovitraps were 
  placed in the surroundings of the residence, in shaded places, and close to 
  other mosquito breeding sites, such as plant vases, remaining for eight to 10 
  days.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, ovitraps 
  were installed in the cities of Planaltina, Sobradinho, Guar&aacute;, N&uacute;cleo 
  Bandeirante, Candangol&acirc;ndia, Gama, Ceil&acirc;ndia, and Taguatinga. This 
  procedure was repeated in 2001 in these cities, with the exception of Gama and 
  Taguatinga. Due to the close proximity of N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante and Candangol&acirc;ndia, 
  and to the small number of eggs collected in the latter, the populations of 
  these two cities were grouped into a single strain - the N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante 
  strain (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). In order to quantify the number of residences 
  with ovitraps, the criterion established by the National Health Foundation (Funasa) 
  - a minimum of 50 ovitraps for cities with up to 20,000 residences and a maximum 
  of 300 for cities with over 500,000 residences - was adopted. Due to the low 
  rates of mosquito infestation, approaching 1% in the dry season, two ovitraps 
  were placed in each residence. In addition, during the dry season (May-September) 
  the number of residences with ovitraps was increased by 20% so that a more representative 
  sample of the mosquitoes could be obtained. In the city of Gama, where another 
  investigation of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> oviposition was taking place (unpublished 
  data), the number of traps was greater than in the other cities.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21748t1.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paddles collected 
  from the ovitraps were placed in Styrofoam boxes for three days for egg incubation. 
  Eggs were counted using a stereoscopic microscope. Positive paddles were placed 
  in polyethylene trays containing three liters of chlorine-free water and 1% 
  alfalfa infusion, so as to facilitate the eclosion of eggs. The larvae generated 
  were fed with autoclaved dog food. Adult mosquitoes (F0 generation) were fed 
  with 10% glucose and with guinea pig blood, and were identified individually 
  as to their species using a stereoscopic microscope. Mosquitoes identified as 
  <i>Ae. aegypti</i> were used for breeding F1 and F2 generations. In the tests 
  carried out with the F0 generations from Planaltina, Ceil&acirc;ndia, Sobradinho, 
  and Gama in 2000, there was no need for species identification, since there 
  was no record of the presence of <i>Ae. albopictus</i> in these areas until 
  2000. The F2 generation was used in 2000 because the number of larvae obtained 
  in the F1 generation was insufficient for performing susceptibility tests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Temephos solution 
  (3 mg/l) were provided by Funasa or prepared from the 98% temephos standard 
  solution (Prodelim Qu&iacute;mica). Solution concentration and purity were verified 
  by gas chromatography using a flame photometric detector and a mass spectrometer 
  detector (GC/FPD, Finnegan 9001; GC/Ion Trap Varian Saturn 2000). Calculated 
  concentrations did not differ significantly from the theoretical concentration 
  (3 mg/l). Tests performed on a same population using different temephos solutions 
  did not show statistically significant differences in terms of mortality rates 
  (p&gt;0,05). Solutions were stored at -5&ordm;C.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Susceptibility 
  tests were carried out according to the methodology proposed by the World Health 
  Organization.<sup>15</sup> Each test included eight repetitions for exposed 
  larvae and four for control larvae. 224 ml distilled water was placed into 400 
  ml plastic cups along with 1.0 ml of 3 mg/l temephos solution (exposed larvae) 
  or 1.0 ml ethanol, PA grade (control larvae). 25 larvae between the third and 
  the beginning of the fourth stage of development were placed into each cup. 
  Final temephos concentration in the system was the diagnostic dose of 0.012 
  mg/l, which is capable of killing, with high probability, all susceptible <i>Ae. 
  aegypti</i> larvae in a population unexposed to insecticide-driven selective 
  pressure and in which resistant individuals are rare.<sup>14</sup> Mortality 
  was verified after 24h. Moribund larvae (presenting tremors, rigidity, or inability 
  to reach the water surface when touched) were considered as dead.<sup>15</sup> 
  All surviving larvae were discarded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parallel tests 
  were carried out with a susceptible strain of Rockefeller <i>Ae. aegypti</i> 
  (ROCK), provided by the Center for Medical Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology 
  - U.S. Department of Agriculture at Gainesville, FL, and with the DIVAL strain, 
  generated from mosquitoes from the Federal District and maintained in the DIVAL 
  insectary since 1997. When mortality rates were equal to or higher than 98%, 
  the population was considered as susceptible (SS); mortalities between 80 and 
  98% were regarded as requiring further verification of the response (VR), and 
  when mortality rates were equal to or below 80%, the population was considered 
  as resistant (RR).<sup>12</sup> Mortality percentages were corrected using Abbot's 
  formula when mortality among controls was between five and 20%. Tests were not 
  considered when control mortality was above 20% or when the number of pupae 
  reached 10%.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excel-MS 1998 software 
  was used for statistical calculations and significance tests. Correlation tests 
  were performed using StatView - SAS Institute Inc., version 5 software. Student's 
  <i>t</i> test was used to verify significant susceptibility differences between 
  populations. Significance levels of <font face="Symbol">a</font>=0.005 and p&gt;<font face="Symbol">a</font> 
  were considered for accepting the null hypothesis (H0), that is, no significant 
  difference between the two samples. H0 was rejected for values below this threshold, 
  that is, there is a significant difference between the two samples.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows the number of ovitraps collected, the ovitrap positivity index (OPI), 
  and the number of eggs collected in each city in the two years of the study. 
  All around, 1,867 of the 1,941 (96.2%) ovitraps installed in 2000, and 837 of 
  the 842 (99.4%) installed in 2001 were recovered. Some of the ovitraps installed 
  were removed by the human population or were without water. OPIs were higher 
  in the rainy season than in the dry season in both years. OPIs were higher in 
  2001 than in 2000 in Planaltina (rainy season) and Ceil&acirc;ndia (dry season).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Tables 
  2</a> and <a href="#tab3">3</a> show <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae mortality according 
  to the city of collection, for 2000 and 2001, respectively. In 2000, the mortality 
  rates of all populations tested were significantly different from those of susceptible 
  strains ROCK and DIVAL (0.001&lt;p&lt;0.01) (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The 
  populations from Taguatinga, Guar&aacute;, and N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante showed 
  mortality rates below 80%, and were therefore resistant to temephos. The populations 
  from Gama, Sobradinho, and Planaltina had altered susceptibility patterns, and 
  were included in the 'verification of response' category (83.6 to 92.8% mortality). 
  The population from Ceil&acirc;ndia was the only one susceptible to temephos 
  (<u>&gt;</u>98%). In all cities, the coefficient of variation (cv) between mortality 
  tests in exposed larvae increased along with decreases in percentage mortality 
  in each population, showing a high genetic variability among the individuals 
  of resistant populations.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001 (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>), the susceptibility levels of the field populations tested were different 
  from those of the ROCK and DIVAL strains (0.01&lt;p&lt;0.05), and these populations 
  were considered as resistant (mortality &lt;80%). Percent mortality in most 
  tested strains was below those of the previous year (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), 
  with the exception of N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante, where mortality was virtually 
  unaltered between both years (p&gt;0.05). Ceil&acirc;ndia showed a change in 
  susceptibility status, from susceptible in 2000 (98.2%) to resistant (66.4%) 
  in 2001 (p&lt;0.001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smaller number 
  of ovitraps installed in Planaltina and Sobradinho in 2001 if compared to 2000 
  (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>) did not compromise sampling, since the distribution 
  of traps was homogeneous in both years. The mortality rates for Planaltina and 
  Sobradinho decreased significantly in 2001 (p&lt;0.001), when they were classified 
  as resistant. These results are consistent with those observed in 2000, when 
  these populations were already showing altered responses (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DIVAL strain 
  showed a different response in 2001 when compared with the ROCK strain (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>). Such reduction was not detected in 2000, probably due to the small number 
  of tests conducted that year (three tests, compared with 15 tests in 2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distances between 
  the cities studied ranged from 5 to 70 km (<a href="#fig1">Figure</a>). In order 
  to evaluate a possible relationship between the distance between two cities 
  and the significance levels obtained in terms of susceptibility, linear regression 
  tests were performed. The regression coefficient obtained (R<sup>2</sup>=-0.101; 
  p=0.16) shows the lack of a significant correlation between the distance between 
  cities and the levels of susceptibility of their respective mosquito populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to determine 
  the existence of a relationship between susceptibility and selective pressure, 
  the total amount of temephos applied in each city in the one-year period preceding 
  sample collection (available in the monthly Mosquito Control Activity reports 
  of DIVAL and Funasa from 1999 and 2000) was analyzed. There was no record of 
  the amount of insecticide applied in the different cities between January and 
  August 1999 and April and September 2000. Generally speaking, the amount of 
  insecticide applied in the one-year period preceding the 2001 sampling was twice 
  that of the 2000 sampling (data not shown). The regression coefficient between 
  the amount of insecticide applied in each city and percent mortality was R<sup>2</sup>=0.039, 
  showing a weak, non significant correlation (p=0.56; <font face="Symbol">a</font>=0.05).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The higher <i>Ae. 
  aegypti</i> oviposition rates in the rainy season observed in the present study 
  were expected, and have been reported by other authors.<sup>5</sup> During this 
  period, the mosquito finds a greater abundance of water-filled deposits - its 
  natural breeding site - and temperature and humidity conditions that favor its 
  biological cycle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of insecticides, 
  associated with environmental management and educational measures should have 
  been able to control mosquito infestations, leading to a reduction in oviposition 
  rates in subsequent years in a same season; however, this did not occur in the 
  period analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strains resistant 
  to a given chemical may appear as a result of genetic, operational, or biological 
  factors. Genetic and biological factors are characteristic of different populations, 
  and include the frequency and the dominant character of resistance genes, isolation, 
  endogamy, and the population's reproductive potential.<sup>12</sup> Operational 
  factors are related to the use of insecticides, and may appear as a result of 
  selective pressure or of failures in control operations.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resistance genes 
  are rare, and appear after prolonged periods of selection, as individuals carrying 
  susceptible alleles die.<sup>3</sup> The degree of dominance of the resistance 
  gene influences the growth of the population under selective pressure. When 
  the resistance gene is recessive, growth is slower; when it is dominant, growth 
  is faster.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, populations 
  with altered responses, showing a typical resistance profile, were detected 
  in Taguatinga, Guar&aacute;, and N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). The populations from Planaltina and Sobradinho, which showed an altered 
  response in 2000, evolved to the resistance profile in 2001. Ceil&acirc;ndia, 
  studied in the dry season, showed the greatest reduction in susceptibility in 
  2001, when the number of eggs collected was almost twice that of 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reduction in 
  OPR observed in Sobradinho in 2001 may be a consequence of control measures 
  adapted by the population and by the healthcare organ. On the other hand, a 
  lower efficiency of these measures might have had an impact on the increase 
  in OPR observed in Planaltina in 2000. In N&uacute;cleo Banderiante, the OPR 
  and the number of eggs in the dry season (2001) was, approximately, 60% lower 
  than in the rainy season (2000). This result was expected, since the rain favors 
  the formation of breeding sites and the increase in mosquito populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greater coefficient 
  of variation in more resistant populations seem to indicate that these populations 
  are heterogeneous in terms of resistance genes. By contrast, the ROCK strain, 
  which is 100% susceptible, is a homogeneous population. The mosquitoes that 
  gave origin to the DIVAL population were collected in 1997 from areas of the 
  Federal District which had been exposed to insecticide application, and may 
  have arrived at the insectary already with resistance genes. Campos &amp; Andrade<sup>4</sup> 
  reported resistance or tolerance to temephos in insectary mosquitoes coming 
  from environments never exposed to insecticide application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Genetic factors 
  may largely explain the differences in susceptibility between the tested populations. 
  In addition, factors such as migration and amount of insecticide applied may 
  also have had an impact on the number of surviving individuals and, consequently, 
  on the evolution of resistance. The influence of migration takes place if susceptible 
  mosquitoes from treated areas escape from treatment, enabling the permanence 
  of susceptible alleles in population, or if there is the immigration of susceptible 
  individuals to a population under selective pressure and where a process of 
  resistance may be already underway.<sup>7</sup> In the present study, however, 
  no correlation between susceptibility levels and the amount of insecticide applied 
  or the distance between cities was found. Rawlins<sup>13</sup> also reported 
  differences in the levels of temephos resistance in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations 
  of nearby neighboring localities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase in 
  resistance is directly dependent on the selective pressure exerted by the insecticide. 
  Since mosquito infestation levels are influenced by seasonality, the amount 
  of temephos applied in each season varies, being greater in the rainy season, 
  when infestation levels are higher. The weak correlation between susceptibility 
  and the amount of insecticide applied found in the present study may, however, 
  be due to the lack of available data regarding insecticide application in some 
  of the months evaluated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  the present study confirm the detection of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations with 
  altered susceptibility to temephos reported in other surveys conducted in Brazil.<sup>10,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The finding of 
  temephos-resistant <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations in the Federal District confirms 
  the need for monitoring the susceptibility of these populations as one of the 
  strategies for ensuring the efficacy of control programs for this vector in 
  the area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once susceptibility 
  levels are mapped, and the impact of resistance on the residual effect of temephos 
  is evaluated in the field, it will be possible to adopt different control strategies, 
  which may be specific for each site. In addition, it will be important to conduct 
  surveys in the area of isolation, and to characterize resistance, in order to 
  determine the biochemical mechanisms and to verify whether the results obtained 
  using the diagnostic test are compatible with the results in terms of the alteration 
  of these mechanisms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The confirmation 
  of the pattern of loss of susceptibility in the Federal District may, for example, 
  indicate the need for changes in chemical control strategies. It is essential, 
  however, that this change be accompanied by integrated control actions, including 
  environmental control, the use of biological insecticides, and the participation 
  of the community.</font></p>
