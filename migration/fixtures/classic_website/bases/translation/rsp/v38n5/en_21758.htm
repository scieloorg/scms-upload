<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  assess the effects of air pollution levels on respiratory morbidity among children 
  from 1999 to 2000.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>Daily records of health center attendance due to respiratory diseases among 
  children were obtained from the public health system in Curitiba, State of Paran&aacute;, 
  Brazil. Daily levels of particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>), smoke, NO<sub>2</sub> 
  and O<sub>3</sub> were obtained from both Paran&aacute; State Environmental 
  Institute and the Development Technology Institute, a non-governmental agency. 
  Daily measurements of temperature and relative humidity were obtained from the 
  National Institute of Meteorology. Generalized additive Poisson regression models 
  were used to assess the relationship between respiratory diseases and air pollution, 
  controlling for long-term seasonality using loess (a non-parametric smoothing 
  function), weather and weekdays. A significance level of 5% was adopted in all 
  the analyses.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>All pollutants presented an effect on respiratory diseases among children. 
  An increase of 40,4 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> in the 3-day moving average of smoke was 
  associated with an increase of 4.5% (95% CI: 1.5-7.6) in the attendance of children 
  with respiratory diseases.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSION: 
  </b>The results suggest that air pollution promotes adverse effects on children's 
  respiratory health even when pollutant levels are lower than the air quality

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The problems stemming 
  from air pollution started to be considered as a question of public health from 
  the time of the industrial revolution, when today's urban development system 
  began. In the 1980s, Brazil's urban development rate reached a level of 68.9%. 
  At that time, the population growth of the Curitiba metropolitan region (State 
  of Paran&aacute;) was 5.8% per year, much greater than in the other metropolitan 
  regions of Brazil.<sup>11,14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this growth 
  diminished during the following decade (to 3% per year), the city of Curitiba 
  has not emerged unscathed from this process. This can today be perceived through 
  a variety of factors, among which the air quality and its possible repercussions 
  in the form of respiratory diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Air pollution affects 
  people's health even when its levels are below what the current legislation 
  determines. The age groups most affected are children<sup>3,4,8</sup> and the 
  elderly.<sup>2,9,1213</sup> These groups are greatly susceptible to the deleterious 
  effects of pollution. Some studies have shown a positive association for morbidity 
  and also mortality in relation to respiratory problems among children.<sup>3,4,8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of information 
  regarding the relationship between air pollution and respiratory diseases in 
  the city prompted the investigation of such relationships in the present study. 
  Thus, the objective of the study was to verify the relationship between air 
  pollutants and morbidity due to diseases of the respiratory tract among the 
  child population</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This work is a 
  time-series ecological study<sup>10</sup> performed in the municipality of Curitiba, 
  State of Paran&aacute;, Brazil. Daily records of the outpatient attendance of 
  children with respiratory diseases at the city's health centers within its public 
  health system, were obtained from the Municipal Health Department. These data 
  relate to the attendance of children within the age group of 0 to 14 years. 
  The period assessed was from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2000. The respiratory 
  diseases were coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 
  9th Revision (ICD-9: 460 to 519).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data on the daily 
  levels of particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) and smoke were obtained from 
  the Paran&aacute; State Environmental Institute (<i>Instituto Ambiental do Paran&aacute;</i>), 
  from measurements at a station. Data relating to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) 
  and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) were supplied by the Development Technology Institute 
  (<i>Instituto de Tecnologia para o Desenvolviment</i> - Lactec), from measurements 
  at two stations (in Curitiba's Industrial City and in the residential district 
  of Santa C&acirc;ndida). The averages from hourly measurements over 24-hour 
  periods for NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and smoke and the peak hourly measurement 
  for O<sub>3</sub> were considered to be representative of the daily concentrations 
  of these pollutants.<sup>5</sup> Braga et al<sup>3</sup> (1999) showed that 
  the averages of the daily levels of pollutants at each monitoring station adequately 
  represented the mean pollutant levels in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo. On the 
  basis of that study, the averages for the pollutants NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> 
  that were measured in the two stations were calculated as representative of 
  the city's mean levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Atmospheric data 
  were obtained from the meteorological station of the Polytechnic Center of the 
  National Meteorology Institute (<i>Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia</i> - 
  INMET), which is located around 6 km from the center of the city of Curitiba. 
  From readings taken at 9:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., figures for the daily 
  averages for the relative humidity of the air and the minimum temperature, for 
  the period from 1999 to 2000, could be obtained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Descriptive statistics 
  were calculated for all the variables included in the study. The Pearson correlation 
  coefficient was calculated between the air pollutants and the number of individuals 
  attended at the health centers per day, and also in relation to the atmospheric 
  variables, with the aim of verifying whether these data presented linear associations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of children 
  attended as outpatients each day because of respiratory diseases (ICD-9: 460 
  to 519) was considered to be the dependent variable, and the mean daily pollutant 
  levels for PM<sub>10</sub>, smoke, O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> were the 
  independent variables. The control variables were the number of days elapsed 
  (t=1, 2, 3, ...., N; where N is the last day of the series), for adjusting the 
  long-term seasonality; the days of the week (indicator variable), for adjusting 
  the short-term seasonality; the daily minimum temperature (&deg;C); and the 
  relative humidity of the air (%). The latter two were for controlling the meteorological 
  effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The daily number 
  of children attended because of respiratory diseases is a counted event and, 
  for this reason, it presents Poisson's distribution. Since the relationships 
  between the dependent variable and the control variables are not necessarily 
  linear, it is important to adopt a regression model that allows such relationships 
  to be estimated in the most appropriate manner. To satisfy these two principles, 
  generalized additive models (GAM)<sup>6</sup> were adopted for Poisson's regression, 
  using nonparametric smoothing functions (<i>loess</i>).<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To control for 
  long-term seasonality, the <i>loess</i> function was utilized for removing the 
  basic long-term seasonal patterns, thereby eliminating variability due to chance 
  occurrences. The smoothing parameter for days elapsed was chosen in such a way 
  as to obtain minimization of the autocorrelation of model residues. To control 
  for short-term seasonality, an indicator variable for the days of the week was 
  adopted. A linear relationship between the dependent variable and the air pollutants, 
  minimum temperature and mean humidity was assumed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biological 
  manifestations of the effects of pollution on health appear to present behavior 
  that shows a lag in relation to the individual's exposure to the polluting agents.<sup>3</sup> 
  In other words, attendance provided on a given day is probably related to the 
  pollution on that day, but also to the pollution that there was on preceding 
  days. Thus, it was decided to utilize daily values and moving averages over 
  two and three days for the pollutants, in which, for example, the three-day 
  moving average is the average for the pollution on the day in question and the 
  two days preceding it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  defining the final regression model, the percentage increases in the number 
  of children attended because of respiratory diseases, and their respective confidence 
  intervals, were estimated for the interquartile variation (the difference between 
  the third and first percentiles) in the concentrations of the pollutants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The significance 
  level of <font face="Symbol">a</font>=5% was adopted for all the regression 
  analyses. The statistical packages utilized were SPLUS for Windows, version 
  4.5, and SPSS 10.0 for Windows.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the study 
  period, 81,229 children were attended due to all the respiratory causes included 
  in chapter VIII of ICD-9.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From <a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a>, it can be seen that in 1999 the PM<sub>10</sub> exceeded the daily limit 
  for air quality (150 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>) twice, smoke six times and O<sub>3</sub> 
  (160 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>) twice. NO<sub>2</sub> did not exceed its limit (320 
  &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>). For the year 2000, the PM<sub>10</sub> again exceeded 
  its limit twice and smoke just once, while NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> 
  did not exceed the acceptable levels for air quality defined by the National 
  Council for the Environment (<i>Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente</i> - Conama)<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the air pollutants 
  were positively correlated with each other (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The 
  greatest correlation was found between the PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2,</sub> 
  thereby indicating a linear association between these pollutants.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/en_21758t2.gif"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An inversely proportional 
  relationship was also observed between the pollutants, the minimum temperature 
  and the relative humidity of the air. For the respiratory diseases, a positive 
  and statistically significant correlation was seen between these and the PM<sub>10</sub>, 
  smoke and NO<sub>2</sub>. The only correlation that was not statistically significant 
  was with O<sub>3</sub>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a> presents the results from the generalized additive models for the study 
  period. It can be seen that the association between the air pollution and attendance 
  due to respiratory diseases was statistically significant for the PM<sub>10</sub>, 
  NO<sub>2</sub> and smoke, both for the daily concentrations and for the two 
  and three-day moving averages, For the O<sub>3</sub>, only the three-day moving 
  average presented a statistically significant effect. The relative risks were 
  generally greater for the three-day moving averages, which demonstrates the 
  cumulative effect of exposure to air pollutants. In the case of O<sub>3</sub>, 
  the effect was also increasing and cumulative, although only the estimate for 
  the three-day moving average presented statistical significance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this was 
  an ecological study,<sup>10</sup> in which the study unit was a group of individuals 
  that could represent a district, a city or even a country, rather than individual 
  observation, it is stressed that such studies have been shown to be efficient 
  with regard to dealing with the effects of pollution on health.<sup>1-4,8,9,12,13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision to 
  work with the total number of respiratory diseases and not according to specific 
  respiratory diseases came from the probability that, in so doing, the diversity 
  of diagnoses among the various services that furnished the original data would 
  be diminished. The use of increasingly sophisticated regression models allowed 
  the possible confounding factors that could interfere in the data analysis to 
  be controlled with greater efficacy. The choice of GAM for the analysis came 
  from the fact that this model allows for adjustment of nonlinear functions for 
  variables that present such behavior. The utilization of Poisson's regression 
  allowed analysis of counted events, such as the number of children attended 
  because of respiratory diseases.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Positive associations 
  were found between the pollutants (PM<sub>10</sub>, smoke, NO<sub>2</sub> and 
  O<sub>3</sub>) and respiratory diseases among children in Curitiba. These effects 
  are similar to what has been found in other Brazilian cities, especially with 
  regard to the findings from the city of S&atilde;o Paulo,<sup>3,4,8</sup> both 
  in relation to the diversity of the associated pollutants and the magnitude 
  of the estimated effects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increased incidence 
  of respiratory diseases during the colder periods of the year is due to two 
  main factors: the low temperatures and the increases in the concentrations of 
  primary pollutants.<sup>1,2,12,13</sup> O<sub>3</sub> is a secondary pollutant 
  that depends on the presence of sunlight and precursors such as nitrogen oxides 
  and hydrocarbons.<sup>5</sup> Dry winters with sunny days provide all the conditions 
  for rises in the levels of this photochemical agent, in the same way as happens 
  in other seasons of the year. Thus, O<sub>3</sub> did not present a high correlation 
  with the other variables analyzed in the present study, since its concentration 
  does not vary in the same way as for the other primary pollutants. Despite this, 
  its oxidizing activity and capacity for inducing inflammatory processes gives 
  this pollutant the role of the villain in causing or aggravating respiratory 
  diseases, as has been reported by other studies.<sup>4,8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NO<sub>2</sub> 
  was the only air pollutant that did not exceed the limits established for air 
  quality, even though it was positively correlated with respiratory diseases. 
  This reinforces the hypothesis that, even when such pollutants do not exceed 
  the standard limits,<sup>5</sup> they may cause effects that are harmful to 
  health. The association between pollution and morbidity/mortality does not display 
  a safe level for pollutants: in other words, no safe level for pollution has 
  been characterized such that, below this level, the pollution would not have 
  any effect.<sup>3,9,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though the 
  analyses utilized models that included one or, at most, two pollutants, it is 
  difficult to attribute the deleterious effects of air pollution on health to 
  just one of these pollutants. The mixing of these elements in the atmosphere 
  may modify their individual toxicity, thereby adding power to their individual 
  effects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis of 
  the results found, it can be inferred that the air pollution levels in Curitiba, 
  despite not being very high, or even when not exceeding the air quality standard 
  (as in the case of NO<sub>2</sub>), do interfere in the morbidity profile of 
  the child population in the city.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is hoped that 
  the results found will be useful, since they allow the risks to which the population 
  is exposed to be measured, and provide backing for drawing up measures aimed 
  at minimizing such risks. Furthermore, the results contribute towards the planning 
  of environmental or urban healthcare and towards improving public policies.</font></p>
