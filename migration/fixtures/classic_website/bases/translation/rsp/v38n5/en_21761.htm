<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  verify the relationship between lead concentration in the enamel of deciduous 
  teeth and the presence of enamel defects and, consequently, with dental caries 
  among preschool children.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>The sample consisted of 329 preschool children in Piracicaba, State of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo: 132 attending municipal kindergartens close to industrial plants and 
  197 attending kindergartens in non-industrial areas. This sample belonged to 
  an initial study made between 2000 and 2001, in which the lead concentration 
  was obtained by means of enamel biopsy. Oral clinical examination of the children 
  from both regions was performed to verify the prevalence of enamel defects, 
  using the Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) Index of the World Dental Federation 
  (FDI), and of dental caries, using the decayed, missing and filled surfaces 
  (dmfs) index of the World Health Organization. The chi-squared test and relative 
  risk calculation were utilized in relation to a significance level of 5%, considering 
  each region separately.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Among the children from the non-industrial area, there was a higher proportion 
  with dental caries among those with higher lead concentrations in deciduous 
  teeth (p=0.02). This was not, however, observed among the children from the 
  industrial area (p=0.89). There was an increased relative risk (RR) of caries 
  among the children from the non-industrial area, but this was not seen among 
  the children from the industrial area. No relationship was observed between 
  the presence of lead and enamel defects.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>No data was found that would give evidence of a relationship between lead 
  concentration and enamel defects in either of the areas studied. No relationship 
  was found between lead and dental caries in the industrial area, thus emphasizing 
  that more studies of such relationships are needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an earlier study,<sup>10</sup> 
  it was found that preschool children living in an industrial region of the city 
  of Piracicaba, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, presented greater lead (Pb) concentrations 
  in their dental enamel than did those living in a non-industrial region. There 
  are reports in the literature indicating that the presence of lead in the chemical 
  composition of dental enamel may alter dental ultrastructure, thereby giving 
  rise to defective enamel. It was therefore considered important to investigate 
  such relationships among this same population of preschool children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this context, 
  <i>in vitro</i> studies have shown that the presence of lead during amelogenesis 
  may cause alterations to the ultrastructure of the enamel,<sup>8</sup> given 
  that ameloblasts are cells that are extremely sensitive to environmental alterations. 
  Such alterations may, in turn, be associated with modifications in the physicochemical 
  behavior of the enamel,<sup>15</sup> thereby making it more susceptible to demineralization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, some studies 
  have indicated that there is an association between the presence of lead in 
  dental tissue and clinical alterations in the enamel. Such variations may relate 
  to coloration<sup>9</sup> or hypoplasia.<sup>1</sup> However, these studies 
  have not been sufficient for establishing a clear relationship between the presence 
  of lead and such enamel defects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A relationship 
  between the presence of lead in the dental tissue and increased dental caries, 
  albeit indirect, has been reported by some researchers.<sup>2,9,17</sup> Nonetheless, 
  the mechanism through which this takes place has not been well established yet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the 
  divergences in the literature and scarcity of data on this subject among Brazilian 
  communities, an epidemiological investigation was made in order to determine 
  the relationship between the presence of lead in dental enamel, enamel defects 
  and caries, in Brazilian children's deciduous teeth. Thus, the objective of 
  the present work was to verify the relationship between the concentration of 
  lead present in the enamel of preschool children's deciduous teeth and the prevalence 
  of enamel defects and caries.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to determine 
  which regions of the city of Piracicaba, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, to be studied, 
  the following bodies were firstly consulted to obtain information on lead pollution 
  in the city: Piracicaba Municipal Department of the Environment, the Environmental 
  Sanitation Technology Company (Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental 
  - Cetesb) and the Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture of the University 
  of S&atilde;o Paulo (CENA/USP). These bodies reported the existence of a car 
  battery factory in an industrial district located in the Dois C&oacute;rregos 
  region, which was taken as the industrial region for the study. The kindergartens 
  located in this industrial region were then found by using a map of the city. 
  Kindergartens in another region known as Campestre, which does not have industrial 
  plants and was taken as the non-industrial region, were also localized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The calculation 
  of the sample size<sup>13</sup> was done by starting from prior knowledge of 
  the prevalence of enamel defects among preschool children in these two regions 
  (the industrial and non-industrial regions), through data collected during a 
  survey in 1999.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The schools health 
  sector of the Piracicaba municipal authorities furnished listings of the children 
  enrolled in the ten kindergartens in the two regions selected for the study. 
  There was a total of 421 children: 209 in the industrial region and 212 in the 
  non-industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of losses, 
  the sample consisted of 329 preschool children of both sexes, aged four and 
  five years old. The adapted Frias Matrix<sup>16</sup> was utilized for the age 
  calculations. In the sample, there were 197 children from six kindergartens 
  in the non-industrial region and 132 children from four kindergartens in the 
  industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delineation 
  of the study was single-blind. The scheduling of the children for them to participate 
  in the study was done by another researcher. It was thus avoided that the examiner 
  would have prior knowledge about the children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The participants 
  were attended at consultation offices in the university dental laboratory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some modifications 
  to the original biopsy technique<sup>3</sup> were made so as to adapt it to 
  the present sample. These modifications were made after performing a pilot study.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The teeth were 
  submitted to professional prophylaxis, using a Robinson-type brush, rubber cup 
  and pumice, followed by washing and drying using air and gauze and relative 
  isolation using cotton wool rolls. These procedures were accomplished by an 
  assistant so that the researcher would not touch any metallic surface before 
  performing the biopsy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adhesive tape with 
  a central perforation of 1.6 mm in diameter (&plusmn;0.03) was firmly stuck 
  onto the vestibular surface of one of the upper central deciduous incisors (51 
  or 61) of each participant in the study, thereby demarcating the area of the 
  biopsy. 5 &micro;l of 1.6 mol/l HCl prepared in 70% glycerol (v/v) was deposited 
  onto this area of exposed enamel. The drop of acid was agitated for 20 seconds, 
  using the end of the pointer, and was then aspirated and transferred to a collecting 
  tube containing 200 &micro;l of MILLI-Q ultrapurified water. To recover the 
  residual acid and dissolved enamel, 5 &micro;l of ultrapurified water was placed 
  on the enamel, agitated for 10 seconds and added to the biopsy solution in the 
  collecting tube. The lead and phosphorus concentrations were determined from 
  this solution, in the laboratory. The phosphorus concentration was used for 
  estimating the mass of the enamel removed by the biopsy. After concluding the 
  biopsy, the tape was removed and the tooth was washed with water for 30 seconds, 
  dried using air jets and again isolated, in order to receive the application 
  of fluoride gel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Control biopsies 
  were performed on the bench surface or on the caps of the pointer supports, 
  so as to check the lead contamination in the working environment during the 
  procedures. All the material utilized and the bench on which the instruments 
  and pipettes were laid out were cleaned using a 10% solution of nitric acid 
  (HNO<sub>3</sub>), in order to remove possible prior lead contamination. The 
  collecting tubes were also previously washed using 10% nitric acid: immersed 
  in the solution for 24 hours and then rinsed 20 times using ultrapurified water 
  and dried under a hood that had been decontaminated from metals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The examinations 
  were conducted under artificial light, with drying of the surface using air 
  and gauze, using a clinical mirror and a CPI (Community Periodontal Index) probe. 
  The prevalence of caries was described using the dmfs index, which consists 
  of summing the decayed, missing and filled surfaces of the deciduous teeth, 
  according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO),<sup>19</sup> 
  and the prevalence of enamel defects using the DDE (developmental defects of 
  enamel) index, which describes the different types of defects, from opacity 
  to hypoplasia.<sup>6</sup> The examinations were conducted by a single calibrated 
  examiner, and the intra-examiner error was calculated. Around 10% of the total 
  sample was randomly selected for reexamination, with calculation of the intra-examiner 
  error during data collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To avoid possible 
  evaporation and loss of sample volume, it was decided to dehydrate the samples 
  by placing them in a desiccator with anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) 
  for 36 hours. This procedure was tested previously to verify that no alterations 
  would occur. At the time when the lead and phosphorus assays were performed, 
  the samples were rehydrated using 210 &micro;l of ultrapurified water, agitated 
  and divided into two parts, for lead and phosphorus assaying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lead determination 
  was performed using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS), 
  calibrated using standard solutions containing 0 to 100 ppb of lead. The sample 
  with 490 &micro;l of a solution of 0.2% (w/v) NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 
  with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.2% HNO<sub>3</sub>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of 
  the phosphorus concentration was done in order to determine the quantity of 
  enamel removed from the tooth surface and the depth of the biopsy, so that the 
  quantity of lead could be calculated in &micro;g per g of enamel removed (ppm). 
  The phosphorus was assayed via the Fiske &amp; Subbarow colorimetric method.<sup>7</sup> 
  Thus, 105 &micro;l of sample, 295 &micro;l of MILLI-Q ultrapurified water and 
  83 &micro;l of molybdic acid were pipetted together and agitated. After 10 minutes, 
  33 &micro;l of reducer were added and the mixture was again agitated. After 
  20 minutes, the color intensity was measured in a spectrophotometer (Beckman 
  DU-70) at 660 nm. The apparatus was calibrated using samples that presented 
  the following known phosphorus concentrations: 0.58 &micro;g/ml, 1.16 &micro;g/ml, 
  2.32 &micro;g/ml, 4.65 &micro;g/ml and 9.30 &micro;g/ml.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that 
  human enamel contains 17% phosphorus by weight, this was the starting point 
  for determining the mass of enamel removed. To determine the thickness of enamel 
  removed by the biopsy, it was assumed that the enamel had a density of 2.95 
  g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on 
  the socioeconomic level of the children studied was collected by applying a 
  questionnaire to each mother or the person responsible for the child, with questions 
  relating to family income and the mothers' education level. This information 
  was collected by the health agents of the kindergartens.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  analysis was done using the SAS (Statistical Analysis System) and Epi Info version 
  5.0 statistical software. Correlation analysis, the chi-squared test and calculations 
  of relative risk (RR) in relation to a significance level of 5% were utilized, 
  and each region was considered separately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present research 
  was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Dentistry School of Piracicaba, 
  Universidade Estadual de Campinas (FOP/Unicamp) (protocol nº. 29/99), 
  in accordance with Resolution 196/96 of the National Commission for Research 
  Ethics (CONEP).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reliability 
  parameters were acceptable and in accordance with the recommendations from the 
  World Dental Federation (FDI)<sup>6</sup> and WHO<sup>18</sup> for the percentage 
  concordance and from Bulman &amp; Osborn<sup>4</sup> for the Kappa concordance 
  index. The training showed an intra-examiner percentage concordance of 97.6% 
  and Kappa of k=0.8 for the caries. For the enamel defects, the percentage concordance 
  was 97.7%. During the data collection, the percentage concordance of the intra-examiner 
  error was 99% for the caries, with Kappa of k=0.9, and 90% concordance for the 
  defects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample loss 
  was 36.8% in the industrial region and 7.1% in the non-industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average value 
  (&plusmn; standard deviation, SD) of phosphorus found in the enamel biopsy samples 
  from the exposed group (industrial region) was 4.1 &micro;g/ml (&plusmn;1.5) 
  and 4.4 &micro;g/ml (&plusmn;1.6) from the non-exposed group (non-industrial 
  region). The average masses of enamel removed (&plusmn; SD) were 0.24 &micro;g 
  (&plusmn;0.095) and 0.25 &micro;g (&plusmn;0.097), respectively. There was no 
  statistical difference in the depths of the biopsies (&plusmn; SD) between the 
  groups from the two regions (p&gt;0.05): these depths were 4.1 &micro;m (&plusmn;1.5) 
  for the exposed group and 4.4 &micro;m (&plusmn;1.6) for the non-exposed group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A negative correlation 
  between lead concentration and the total number of enamel defects was found 
  in the non-industrial region (r<sup>2</sup>=-0.1497 and p=0.0357), while such 
  a correlation was not observed in the industrial region (p&gt;0.05). When the 
  total number of defects was discriminated, there were no correlations (p&gt;0.05) 
  between lead concentration and hypoplasia, lead concentration and demarcated 
  opacity and lead concentration and diffuse opacity, either in the industrial 
  or non-industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results for 
  the relationship between lead concentration and enamel defects (presence/absence) 
  in the industrial and non-industrial regions are expressed in <a href="#tab1">Table

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to <a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>, no statistically significant difference was found between the regions 
  (p&gt;0.05) with regard to the presence/absence of enamel defects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relative risks 
  between lead concentration (140 and 220 ppm) and enamel defects (presence/absence) 
  were 1.01 (0.87&lt;RR&lt;1.16) and 1.03 (0.89&lt;RR&lt;1.19), respectively, 
  for the industrial region, and 1.03 (0.91&lt;RR&lt;1.16) and 0.99 (0.86&lt;RR&lt;1.14), 
  respectively, for the non-industrial region, thus showing that there was no 
  risk (p&gt;0.05).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a statistically 
  significant difference for the proportions of individuals with presence of caries 
  and lead concentrations of more than 140 and 220 ppm, in relation to those with 
  presence of caries and lead concentrations of less than or equal to 140 and 
  220 ppm, only for the non-industrial region (p=0.0223 and p=0.0141, respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was an increased 
  risk of caries among children from the non-industrial region who had lead concentrations 
  of more than the median and average: 1.40 (1.05&lt;RR&lt;1.88) and 1.46 (1.10&lt;RR&lt;1.93), 
  respectively. This was not seen among the children from the industrial region: 
  0.98 (0.67&lt;RR&lt;1.43) and 0.89 (0.60&lt;RR&lt;1.32).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a statistically 
  significant difference in family income (p&lt;0.0001) and education level (p&lt;0.0001) 
  between the groups from the industrial and non-industrial regions: these levels 
  were greater in the industrial region.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lead concentrations 
  in the deciduous teeth were analyzed in two ways (median and average), because 
  no defined reference values exist in the literature for the concentrations in 
  dental enamel that would reflect a condition of lead poisoning or, furthermore, 
  would relate to enamel defects and caries. The studies in the Brazilian literature 
  have established reference values only for blood and have reported the importance 
  of verifying lead levels as a routine examination.<sup>14</sup> However, blood 
  measurements indicate acute lead contamination, thus differing from dental enamel, 
  which indicates past contamination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, no 
  relationship was found between any of the lead concentrations analyzed in the 
  present study and enamel defects in the deciduous teeth. The results from the 
  correlations and the relative risks between lead concentrations and enamel defects, 
  when these existed, were weak. For the non-industrial region, for which the 
  correlation was negative, this relationship ought to be better investigated, 
  considering that this result diverges from some reports in the literature.<sup>1,10</sup> 
  However, the latter reports did not produce conclusive results and reported 
  the relationship between lead in dental tissue and enamel defects in an indirect 
  manner. Moreover, in examining the <a href="#fig1">Figure</a> of the present 
  study, it can be seen that, in the industrial region, there were more cases 
  of children with enamel defects even in the absence of lead concentration, thereby 
  indicating that other factors must be contributing towards the presence of these 
  defects. Besides this, the visualization of the industrial and non-industrial 
  regions in the <a href="#fig1">Figure</a> allows the observation that, where 
  there were greater lead concentrations, there were greater numbers of enamel 
  defects in the industrial region than in the non-industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  the relationship between lead and caries, surprisingly, a greater proportion 
  of individuals with the presence of caries at lead concentrations of more than 
  the median and average was observed in the non-industrial region. However, it 
  was seen that, in the industrial region, both the mother's education level and 
  the family income were greater than those in the non-industrial region. These 
  may have acted as confounding factors that could have exercised a role that 
  perhaps was more important than the environmental lead contamination in the 
  industrial region. Although the characterization of socioeconomic levels from 
  the education network has been utilized by other researchers,<sup>12</sup> in 
  the present work this appears not to have been a variable that homogenized the 
  groups in relation to similarity of socioeconomic level. Another matter that 
  may have interfered was the greater sample loss in the industrial region.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One important epidemiological 
  finding was that the relative risk of having caries was greater among the children 
  living in the non-industrial region who presented lead concentrations of more 
  than 140 and 220 ppm in their deciduous teeth. This result reaffirms the tendency 
  reported in the literature towards a relationship between presence of lead in 
  dental tissue and increased prevalence of caries.<sup>2,9,17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No data were found 
  that would give evidence of a relationship between the lead concentration in 
  the enamel of deciduous teeth and enamel defects, in either of the regions studied, 
  However, a relationship was found between lead and caries in the non-industrial 
  region, thus emphasizing the need for more studies on such relationships, taking 
  into consideration the importance of socioeconomic factors in caries.</font></p>
