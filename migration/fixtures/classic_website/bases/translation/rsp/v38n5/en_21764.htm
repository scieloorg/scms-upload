<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Objective measures 
  to evaluate quality of life are gaining importance as an adjuvant in assessing 
  therapeutic interventions. The study purpose was to compare quality of life 
  in renal transplant patients with functioning graft and those who restarted 
  dialysis after graft loss. Quality of life was measured using the World Health 
  Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-Bref). One hundred and thirty 
  two patients were interviewed, and divided into two groups: group I, 100 patients 
  on regular follow-up in outpatient clinics and stable graft functioning; and 
  group II, 32 patients who restarted dialysis after graft loss. The WHOQOL-Bref 
  showed better quality of life in those renal transplant patients with a functioning 
  graft, especially regarding the physical and psychological domains assessed 
  in the general questions. There were no differences between the groups in the 
  social relationship and environmental domains. WHOQOL-Bref is an efficient tool 
  and can be useful for better approaching these patients, not only on a medical 
  basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Objective measures 
  of life quality have become an adjuvant tool in the analysis of therapeutic 
  interventions and individuals' level of satisfaction with their health and treatment.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Health 
  Organization defined quality of life as "<i>the individual's perception of their 
  life status concerning the context of culture and value system in which they 
  live and their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns</i>".<sup>1</sup> 
  It is thus a concept that entails several meanings and relates to the individual's 
  level of satisfaction in different spheres of life.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quality of life 
  can be assessed using both general and specific instruments.<sup>4</sup> The 
  measure of quality of life in chronic degenerative disease patients has been 
  investigated in recent years aiming at defining the changes needed for improving 
  these patients' well-being and adequacy of their rehabilitation.<sup>2,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose was 
  to assess quality of life in a population of chronic renal transplant patients.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study population 
  comprised of a sample of 132 subjects who underwent renal transplant in a university 
  hospital between 1984 and 2001 (N=1.000), regardless of kidney donor type (cadaveric 
  or living-related donor). Transplant subjects were divided into two groups:</font></p>
    
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/quadrado.gif" align="absmiddle"> 
    Group I - transplant subjects with a functioning graft followed up on an outpatient 
    basis (N=580).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n5/quadrado.gif" align="absmiddle"> 
    Group II - transplant subjects who restarted dialysis after graft loss (N=420). 
    Of all, 180 subjects were not included in the study because they died and 
    60 subjects were either lost to follow-up or aged less than 18. Only 180 were 
    undergoing dialysis.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Health 
  Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref) questionnaires were applied from 
  September to December 2002. Sampling was carried out according to the usual 
  order subjects attended their visits in the renal transplant outpatient clinic 
  of the Nephrology Unit. A proportional rate sampling was applied to both subgroups, 
  i. e., as a given percentage of subjects who loss graft was reached, the same 
  percentage of subjects with functioning grafts had to be interviewed. The sampling 
  process was stopped at 17% rate, which was considered to be adequate for the 
  study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Group I, there 
  were interviewed 100 renal transplant patients (65 males and 35 females, mean 
  age 40&plusmn;10 years) followed up on an outpatient basis, making up to 17% 
  of all outpatients (N=580) in the Unit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Group II consisted 
  of 32 subjects who restarted dialysis after graft loss (12 males and 20 females, 
  mean age 39&plusmn;11 years), making up to 17% of the target population (N=180).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inclusion criteria 
  included: literacy, no severe cognitive impairment, and agreeing to sign an 
  informed consent form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The instrument 
  used to assess quality of life was the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire, Portuguese 
  version,<sup>1</sup> which comprised of 24 questions on the following domains: 
  physical, psychological, social and environment relationships and two general 
  questions. Each domain was assessed separately and higher scores represented 
  better quality of life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical analysis 
  was conducted using the SPSS software program including the instrument's specific 
  syntaxes and modified scores from four to 20. Each domain score medians were 
  compared between the two groups at a 5% significance level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the University of Campinas School of Medical Sciences Research Ethics Committee.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group comparison 
  showed no significant difference for the following variables: age, marital status, 
  donor type, schooling, employment, and income. The Chi-square test (p&lt;0.05) 
  showed that only gender and occupational status were significantly different 
  in both groups.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Median analysis 
  of the questionnaire's specific domain scores revealed better scores for the 
  physical domain (15.4 <i>vs</i> 13.7; p&lt;0.05) and borderline significant 
  values for the psychological domain (16.0 <i>vs</i> 14.3; p=0.05) in the functioning 
  graft group. However, there was no significant difference for the domains social 
  (16.0 <i>vs</i> 14.7; p=ns) and environment relationships (14.0 <i>vs</i> 13.0; 
  p=ns).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The assessment 
  of general questions, "<i>How do you rate your quality of life?"</i> and <i>"Are 
  you satisfied with your current level of health?</i>" showed global higher scores 
  for the functioning graft group (16.0 <i>vs</i> 14.0, p&lt;0.05) as expected.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As expected, the 
  assessment of quality of life using the general WHOQOL-Bref statistically corroborated 
  the notion that renal transplant patients with functioning grafts have a better 
  quality of life when compared to those who restarted dialysis after graft loss. 
  The instrument has proved to have good discriminant validity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bearing in mind 
  that, as renal failure advances, patients start to have more symptoms that interfere 
  with their daily activities, more advanced stages of renal disease could directly 
  impact in the individual's perception of their quality of life. Likewise, the 
  dialysis therapy (either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory dialysis peritoneal, 
  CAPD) has also an impact on the assessment of patients' quality of life since 
  not all symptoms are eliminated with treatment. Renal transplant, advocated 
  as a treatment that would assure the individual to be back to their daily activities 
  can also be associated with not very satisfactory scores of quality of life, 
  particularly in those individuals experiencing acute graft rejection or adverse 
  events resulting from immunosuppressive therapy.<sup>6</sup> Another factor 
  to bear in mind is that after the introduction of more powerful immunosuppressive 
  drugs, patient and graft survival has increased creating a new set of chronic 
  rejection patients who restart dyalisis.<sup>5</sup> Restarting dialysis can 
  also have a negative impact on the assessment of quality of life, particularly 
  in those who used to be active transplant patients. On the other hand, those 
  individuals who had frequent complications after their transplant may see restarting 
  dialysis as a way of improving their quality of life.<sup>3</sup> Thus, the 
  authors believe that the best approach to these patients is applying serial 
  questionnaires for assessing quality of life to allow for therapy adequacy and 
  a multidisciplinary approach, and defining specific preventive programs to each 
  particular group aiming at improving their quality of life. Serial questionnaire 
  application could be also a way of assessing these programs' efficacy.</font></p>
