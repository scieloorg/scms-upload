<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: </b>To 
  verify the adequacy of hospital resources for perinatal care in Belo Horizonte, 
  MG, Brazil in 1996.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>METHODS: 
  </b>This is a cross-sectional study conducted encompassing all the 28 maternity-hospitals 
  in the city of Belo Horizonte, capital of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
  A model of evaluation denominated "<i>N&iacute;veis de Complexidade e Seguran&ccedil;a 
  em Potencial de Unidades Perinatais de Hospitais-Maternidade</i>" <i>&#91;Levels 
  of Complexity and Potential Safety in Maternity-Hospitals&#93;</i>. This model is 
  based on the evaluation of three major areas in the hospital: general structure, 
  perinatal clinical infra-structure and resources available in perinatal units. 
  Two scores involving these three areas were created. When evaluating low risk 
  perinatal care, the score may sum to a total of 1,000 points. On the other hand, 
  when high to medium perinatal risk care is considered, the score may sum to 
  2,000 points. Hosptals that scored more than 500 points were classified in two 
  levels: I-A and I-B (for low risk); and six levels I-A through III-B (for medium/high 
  risk).<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Five hospitals were classified as level 0 according to the low risk score, 
  that is, they were not considered adequate to assist any delivery. When the 
  medium/high risk score was employed, a total of seven hospitals were considered 
  inadequate to assist any delivery.<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>This evaluation model was capable of classifying hospitals according to 
  available infra-structure for perinatal care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A rate of infant 
  mortality in the municipality of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, decreased 
  from 54.1/1,000, in 1981, to 31.4/1,000, in 1996. In 2001, it was down to 14.1/1,000, 
  principally due to the resolution of post-neonatal deaths. However, the rate 
  of neonatal deaths is still high, being responsible for more than 50% of the 
  infant mortality.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> This behavior 
  has also been reported in other studies.<sup>8</sup> The rate of perinatal mortality 
  has been used as an indicator of the quality of health care. However, it suffers 
  the influence of several confounding factors in the health services and, therefore, 
  may not be a sensitive and reliable quality indicator.<sup>17</sup> Furthermore, 
  the information available on death certificates is short of the desirable level. 
  <sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some authors have 
  demonstrated that unfavorable hospital conditions are prejudicial to newborn, 
  even to those of normal weight. Once it is born, mortality of the low-weight 
  newborn (LWNB) may no longer be attributed to prenatal care, but to assistance 
  during delivery and afterwards.<sup>27</sup> In Western countries, perinatal 
  mortality could be reduced in up to 25% with improvements in maternal and perinatal 
  assistance.<sup>4,20</sup> In Belo Horizonte, a study undertaken in 1993 indicated 
  that 68.5% of the neonatal deaths occurred in hospitals that didn't have adequate 
  neonatal assistance.<sup>1</sup> Another study undertaken in 1999 indicated 
  that, according to Wigglesworth's classification and utilizing 1,000 grams birthweight 
  as a reference for fetal vitality, 60% of the neonatal deaths could have been 
  prevented.<sup>12,13</sup> The "rate of evitable deaths" in the Northeast was 
  40% and it was proposed as an indicator of the quality of the local health care 
  system.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, according 
  to data from the <i>Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Nascidos Vivos</i> 
  (SINASC) &#91;Information System on Live Births&#93;, only 3.2% of the births occur 
  outside the hospital environment.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  Therefore a continuous and permanent evaluation of hospital infrastructure has 
  become imperative.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are minimal 
  technical standards which must be met in order for maternity hospitals to function 
  properly. In the majority of the developed countries - such as the United States, 
  New Zealand and Australia - these standards are guaranteed by Hospital Accrediting 
  Programs. In Brazil, these programs are still incipient, being restricted to 
  only a few states of the federation, such as Parana and Sao Paulo.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The absence of 
  an effective Hospital Accrediting Program in Belo Horizonte, as well as in the 
  rest of the country, led the authors to elaborate a duly tested model of evaluation 
  of perinatal units in maternity hospitals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of 
  the present study was to evaluate the infrastructure of maternity hospitals 
  and classify them according to this model.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A questionnaire 
  with 300 variables was applied in all 28 maternities in Belo Horizonte, in 1996. 
  This questionnaire addressed three areas: a) general hospital infrastructure; 
  b) clinical perinatal infrastructure and c) physical, technological and human 
  resources in the perinatal units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, a pre-test 
  was undertaken and, following that, a pilot study conducted in four maternity 
  hospitals with distinct levels of complexity.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  In the pilot study, the adequacy of the questionnaire was evaluated, in terms 
  of the sequence of questions asked, as well as their format and clarity. The 
  variables that were less subject to observational errors and which were more 
  capable of differentiating the hospitals among themselves were maintained in 
  the final version of the questionnaire. After the pilot study was completed, 
  the manual for filling out the questionnaire was elaborated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information on 
  the questionnaire was obtained by means of direct observation <i>in loco,</i> 
  in each of the maternities, by four investigators: a main investigator, who 
  was an intensive care pediatrician and neonatologist with formal training and 
  experience in hospital administration; a nurse with experience in the field 
  of hospital audits; an obstetrician with experience in service management and 
  a neonatologist pediatrician. All the members of the team had experience in 
  hospital evaluation and received specific training for this study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information obtained 
  by means of direct observation includes verifying the existence, number and 
  quality of physical and technological resources (such as neonatal transport 
  incubators and mechanical respirators, for example) as well as the conditions 
  under which they were utilized. The general hospital infrastructure was also 
  evaluated: clinical analysis laboratories, radiology, ultrasound, transfusion 
  units, pharmacy, laundry, milk dispensary and electric energy generator.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Questions concerning 
  human resources within perinatal assistance attempted to identify the number 
  of professionals, the period of time they were present at the meternity &#151; shifts 
  (mornings, afternoons, nights and weekends) &#151; of at least 18 professional categories 
  (for example, obstetricians, pediatricians, nurses and physiotherapists)and 
  were answered by the head of the sectors and services.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coherence and consistency 
  of the shifts, for example, whether or not the member of a specific category 
  was actually physically present during his/her 24-hour shift, including weekend 
  shifts, was verified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evaluation of the 
  committee to control hospital infections limited itself to the verification 
  of the minutes of the meetings of the <i>Comiss&atilde;o de Controle de Infec&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Hospitalar</i> (CCIH)&#91;Committee for the Control of Hospital Infections&#93; and 
  to the notices placed in critical areas of the hospitals with recommendations. 
  Resolutions of the hospital's Board of Directors with the nominations of its 
  members according to legislation and/or the Ministry of Health's recommendations 
  were also taken into consideration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average length 
  of time necessary to register information concerning the 300 variables included 
  in the questionnaire was eight hours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to quantify 
  the data concerning hospital infrastructure so as to classify the maternity 
  hospitals in Belo Horizonte, two scores were developed: one of these utilized 
  a maximum of 1,000 points to evaluate the potential security of care received 
  during pregnancy, labor and delivery in habitual risk births (pregnant women/ 
  newborns clinically diagnosed as minimal risk); and another score with a maximum 
  of 2,000 points, used in evaluating the potential security of care in medium/high 
  risk pregnancies. Each of the 300 variables received between 5 and 50 points, 
  corresponding to its importance as a criterion of "potential safety" in the 
  maternity hospitals, considering the three areas being evaluated. Items considered 
  essential and complete for perinatal care were assigned the largest number of 
  points.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A classification/evaluation 
  system was elaborated, being denominated <i>n&iacute;veis de complexidade e 
  seguran&ccedil;a em potencial para unidades perinatais de hospitais-maternidade</i> 
  (NCSPHM) &#91;Levels of complexity and potential security for perinatal units in 
  maternity hospitals&#93;. Seven strata were utilized to evaluate the scores obtained 
  by the hospitals (see <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). The first strata, which 
  includes the hospitals that obtained 500 points, corresponds to 25% of those 
  classified within the 2,000 point score total attributed to medium and high 
  risk care, and 50% of the maximum 1,000 point score total attributed to habitual 
  risk care. The hospitals were then classified according to the total number 
  of points they received. The levels, from I to III, were subdivided in A and 
  B, corresponding to a division in quartiles, so as to better classify and differentiate 
  the hospitals from one another, as in other scores. Thus, a hospital classified 
  as B has greater complexity and, possibly, greater potential security. Since 
  the classification of care at delivery for habitual risk births has, at most, 
  a 1,000 point score, within the criteria defined below, hospitals evaluated 
  for this type of care may only attain, at most, the I-B level. On the other 
  hand, when evaluating care for medium/high risk births, the hospitals can attain 
  a maximum of 2,000 points and may be classified, at most, as level III-B.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to guarantee 
  secrecy, each of the maternities received a code number ranging from 1 to 28. 
  Data were stored in a computer databank, utilizing the Epi Info 6.04 program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study was 
  approved by the <i>Comit&ecirc; de &Eacute;tica em Pesquisa da Universidade

  of Minas Gerais&#93;. (Parecer COEP 104/98 de 3/2/99).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution 
  of points in the areas of general hospital infrastructure of the 28 maternity 
  hospitals of Belo Horizonte in the year 1996 may be observed on <a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>. The areas in which maternities displayed greatest variability were general 
  hospital infrastructure (area A) and physical, technological and human resources 
  of the perinatal units (area C). When care for medium/high risk births was evaluated, 
  the physical, technological and human resources of the perinatal units (area 
  C) presented the greatest potential for differentiating the institutions and 
  determining their final classification.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hospital which 
  were classified in the intermediary level, I-A for habitual risk, I-A, II-A 
  e II-B for medium/high risk presented delimited structural deficiencies, some 
  of which were very serious. If some of these deficiencies/variables (see <a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>) with a high potential for differentiating the institutions, for example, 
  complete hygienization of the nursery, had been used as a criteria for exclusion, 
  23 hospitals (82%) would have been considered level zero.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the hospitals 
  that attained the highest level of classification (I-B; III-A e III-B), with 
  respect to the evaluations for habitual or medium/high risk, presented this 
  deficiency. The committees for control of hospital infections undertook an active 
  search for infections in all but one of the hospitals investigated and, in 26 
  hospitals, they conducted inspections of the antibiotics in stock.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rest of the 
  variables that appear in <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>, such as the existence 
  of a milk dispensary and intensive care incubators; electric generators in critical 
  sectors; oxygen analyzers (which analyze the fraction of inspired oxygen) in 
  the nurseries and a anesthetic recovery room, were present in all the hospitals 
  classified in category III-B.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final classification/evaluation 
  (sum of the scores in areas A, B and C) of the 28 maternity hospitals in terms 
  of habitual and medium/high risk respectively may be observed on <a href="#fig1">Figures 
  1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>. Five hospitals (17.9%) (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a>) did not provide what was considered the minimal conditions of complexity 
  and potential security (CCPS) to care for women during habitual risk deliveries 
  and births or for habitual risk newborns (level 0 &#151; a score of less than 500 
  points). Another 13 hospitals (46.4%) presented CCPS scores considered adequate 
  (level IB &#151; scores higher than 750 points). Ten maternity hospitals (35.7%) 
  are in an intermediary position (level IA &#151; scoring from 501 to 750 points).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the score 
  developed for evaluating hospitals with a level of complexity which should qualify 
  them to care for medium/high risk births and newborns (maximum of 2,000 points) 
  is taken into consideration (see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), two more maternity 
  hospitals (25.0%) are classified as level zero (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). 
  Six maternity hospitals (21.4%) (level I-A) presented CCPS slightly higher, 
  although still clearly unsatisfactory for this level of care. The nine maternity 
  hospitals (32.1%) classified as levels II-A and II-B presented what may be considered 
  intermediary CCPS in terms of care for medium/high risk births and newborns. 
  The level III-A and III-B maternity hospitals, a total of two and three hospitals, 
  respectively, presented adequate conditions of care. None of the hospitals in 
  this study were classified in the I-B category.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision to 
  develop this questionnaire was motivated by the lack of a national protocol 
  for evaluating maternity hospitals according to a score. Existing studies evaluate 
  several items of the infrastructure and of human resources, but do not utilize 
  scores which make it possible to undertake a "global" evaluation of the maternities. 
  That is, the pre-existing methods may indicate the percentage of maternities 
  in which a specific resource is or is not available, but do not establish a 
  hierarchical system among these maternities.<sup>3,16,19,20,22</sup> Neither 
  does the <i>Manual Brasileiro de Acredita&ccedil;&atilde;o Hospitalar</i> &#91;Brazilian 
  Hospital Accreditation Manual&#93;, provide a scoring system.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some authors believe 
  that the evaluation of hospital infrastructure should not be undertaken in an 
  isolated manner, for, despite the fact that it is capable of guaranteeing safety 
  in care during birth and in the post-partum period, for both the mother and 
  the newborn, diminishing the probability of unfavorable results, it does not 
  guarantee the quality of the processes involved.<sup>1,7,17</sup> For this reason, 
  the expression "in potential" appears in the this study, indicating that the 
  presence or absence resources (infrastructure), but not the process of producing 
  care and/or the results, such as rates of mortality, among others were analyzed. 
  Among the existing models of hospital evaluation, the <i>obstetrical quality 
  indicators and data collection</i>, created by a multi-professional and inter-institutional 
  pan-European network, evaluates 50 items associated to childbirth, with much 
  greater emphasis on results than on infrastructure.<sup>10</sup> In the model 
  proposed by Le Fevre et al,<sup>15</sup> utilized by the <i>National Institute 
  of Child Health and Human Development</i>, infrastructure is hardly taken into 
  consideration, for the central line of evaluation is the qualification of human 
  resources. Some studies involving results have also been conducted in Brazil, 
  generally these utilize rates of mortality, more frequently rates of infant 
  mortality. In the Central-Western region of Brazil, it was observed, by crossing 
  information from different databanks, utilizing the technique of logistic regression, 
  that being born in a public state hospital was a risk factor for mortality in 
  the neonatal period. This result may reflect some kind of structural deficit.<sup>19</sup> 
  In Sao Luis, Maranhao State, it was stated that the expressive increase in neonatal 
  mortality from 1995 to the present indicates a decrease in the quality of obstetric 
  and neonatal care. This, in turn, is attributed to the high rates of cesarean 
  sections and overcrowding in the nurseries.<sup>20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, 
  evaluation of hospital infrastructure, even if in na isolated manner, is important, 
  for adequate foundations of the health services are associated to the reduction 
  of maternal and infant mortality.<sup>5,11,14,23-25</sup> Furthermore, in Brazil, 
  hospital infrastructure is still an important concern; it is for this reason 
  that studies tend to evalluate this item in more detail.<sup>3,16,22</sup> In 
  the study conducted by the <i>Conselho Regional de Medicina do Estado de S&atilde;o 
  Paulo</i> &#91;S&atilde;o Paulo State Regional Council of Medicine&#93;,<sup>3</sup> 
  it was found that only 24% of the maternities possessed complete reanimation 
  units and only 30% had pediatricians on shift in the delivery room; 65% of the 
  nurseries didn't employ pediatricians as part of the regular daily staff of 
  the nurseries. Furthermore, many maternity hospitals presented deficiencies 
  with respect to equipments, such as portable X-rays, incubators, and radiant 
  warmers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis of <a href="#fig1">Figures 
  1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a> reveals that perinatal care in Belo Horizonte, 
  in the year 1996, was delivered in maternity hospitals that were heterogeneous 
  from the perspective of their foundations, some didn't have the minimum infrastructure 
  required to care for women during delivery or for their low risk newborn. These 
  hospitals, classified as level zero, presented serious structural deficiencies 
  for whatever type of care being delivered, such as the absence of a neonatal 
  resuscitation unit, of a complete higienization unit in the nursery, of a milk 
  dispensary, of electric generators in critical sectors, of qualified human resources 
  for immediate and sequential treatment of the newborn and of pregnant women 
  as well as for women during the puerperium. It has already been shown that the 
  absence of complete hygienization in the nurseries is an important risk factor 
  for the occurrence of episodes of hospital infections, which, in turn, is the 
  main determinant of neo-natal morbi-mortality.<sup>17</sup> Furthermore, activities 
  undertaken by Committees for the Control of Hospital Infection are not sufficient 
  to guarantee the quality of perinatal care.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patients attended 
  in these hospitals are certainly exposed to unnecessary and evitable risks. 
  The fact that maternity and neonatal care is not organized in a hierarchical 
  system greatly increases the risks for the population for any one of the 28 
  maternity hospitals delivered care to both women in labor and newborn classified 
  as high risk. The existence of a complete neonatal resuscitation unit, found 
  only in 10 hospitals (36.0%), demonstrates the inadequacy of the hospital network. 
  The fact that obstetric care is not regionalized and hierarchically organized 
  in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro was associated with evitable perinatal 
  mortality.<sup>12,13,21</sup> Another indicator of the precariousness of perinatal 
  care as practiced in Belo Horizonte is the rate of maternal mortality, which, 
  was 71.8 per 100,000 live births in 1998, whereas, in developed countries, it 
  is less than 10 per 100,000 live births.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the limitations 
  of the present study is that a maternity hospital which does not possess an 
  important item in perinatal care may have a higher score than another one that 
  has this item because it received more points on other items. A concrete example 
  is the fact that one of the maternities, which did not have a complete resuscitation 
  unit, accumulated a sufficient number of points on other items to be classified 
  as level III-B. On the other hand, it was verified that this hospital presented 
  adequate infrastructure with respect to the other items, justifying its high 
  score, which distinguishes it from the other hospitals. In this case, eventual 
  financial resources could be directed to this hospital so that it could install 
  a complete neonatal resuscitation unit. If a process of regionalization and 
  hierarchical organization of maternity and neonatal care takes place, this hospital 
  would occupy a prominent position.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another limitation 
  was the fact that rigor with respect to the collection of data in the three 
  areas was not homogeneous, for the questions concerning human resources were 
  answered by the heads of the respective departments and services; evaluation 
  of the Committees for the Control of Hospital infection was based on the minutes 
  of the meetings; and evaluation of general and perinatal infrastructure, as 
  well as physical and technological resources was based on direct observation 
  by the team of investigators. However, this does not invalidate the study, for 
  the same methodology was applied to all maternity hospitals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors consider 
  that the methodology of this study corresponds to the proposed objectives, making 
  it possible to classify the maternity hospitals of the municipality. This does 
  not occur in the majority of national studies in which a scoring system is utilized.<sup>3,16,18,22</sup> 
  Furthermore, the model proposed may make it easier to identify the maternity 
  hospitals with less infrastructure and human resources, which scored fewer points 
  and, for this reason, are in need of immediat intervention/evaluation. An external 
  indicator of the adequacy of the present study is exemplified by the fact that 
  two years after the study was concluded, in 1998, the health administrator of 
  the municipality of Belo Horizonte, redirected care for pregnant women in this 
  city. The five hospitals which were classified as level zero for habitual risk 
  in this study were removed from the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  &#91;Brazilian Public Health System&#93; after being re-evaluated by technical personnel 
  from the Municipal Department of Health of Belo Horizonte. Another external 
  indicator was the utilization of the score system of this study to evaluate 
  maternity hospitals in Goiania, GO, in the year 2003.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lapses encountered 
  in this study may be corrected by attributing different scores to the given 
  variables and by including and/or excluding other variables.</font></p>
