<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To evaluate recurrent neural networks as a predictive technique for time-series 
  in the health field.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The study was carried out during a cholera epidemic which took 
  place in 1993 and 1994 in the state of Cear&aacute;, northeastern Brazil, and 
  was based on excess deaths having 'poorly defined intestinal infections' as 
  the underlying cause (ICD-9). The monthly number of deaths with due to this 
  cause between 1979 and 1995 in the state of Cear&aacute; was obtained from the 
  Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System (SIM). A network comprising 
  two neurons in the input layer, twelve in the hidden layer, one in the output 
  layer, and one in the memory layer was trained by backpropagation using the 
  fist 150 observations, with 0.01 learning rate and 0.9 momentum. Training was 
  ended after 22,000 epochs. We compare the results with those of a negative binomial 
  regression.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>ANN forecasting was adequate. Excessive mortality (number of 
  deaths above the upper limit of the confidence interval) was detected in December 
  1993 and October/November 1994. However, negative binomial regression detected 
  excess mortality from March 1992 onwards.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The artificial neural network showed good predictive ability, 
  especially in the initial period, and was able to detect alterations concomitant 
  and a subsequent to the cholera epidemic. However, it was less precise that 
  the binomial regression model, which was more sensitive to abnormal data concomitant 
  with cholera circulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prediction 
  of events in epidemiological surveillance is aimed at planning the future needs 
  of Public health and at detecting of disturbances in behavior within a time 
  series, which may indicate an excessive number of cases or deaths. Techniques 
  employed to this end include adjustment to periodic functions, the ARIMA<sup>4</sup> 
  models, and Poisson's regression.<sup>1,4,19,16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  goals of epidemiological surveillance is the detection of epidemics. This is 
  accomplished by analyzing either disease notification data, healthcare service 
  usage or mortality data. From the statistical standpoint, to detect an epidemic 
  is to detect the presence of abnormal values within a time series. The detection 
  of abnormalities based on notification levels from the previous five years<sup>18</sup> 
  is used in certain countries – the US, for example – in routine epidemiological 
  surveillance. When the goal is to detect excess mortality, longer periods are 
  generally used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Excess mortality 
  was introduced into epidemiological surveillance in the context of evaluating 
  the impact of influenza epidemics.<sup>5</sup> This was due to difficulties 
  in classifying influenza-related deaths, which were, in their majority, attributed 
  to complications of the infection, such as pneumonia. The concept of excess 
  mortality was also used in evaluating the impact of heat waves, atmospheric 
  pollution, and of apparently benign epidemics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Epidemiological 
  surveillance in Brazil shows greater operational variability than in developed 
  countries, which results in decreased precision (greater variance) of the data 
  and consequently less sensitivity of the notification system in detecting new 
  diseases and the occurrence of epidemics. Thus, the use of excess mortality 
  techniques may prove useful for increasing the sensitivity of the surveillance 
  system, since mortality registration has higher coverage and longer available 
  time series than the notification system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
  the statistical methods traditionally used require profound knowledge of statistics 
  for the selection and evaluation of models, which prevents them from being used 
  in a decentralized manner.<sup>3,17</sup> Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), 
  on the other hand, have the advantage of being applicable to several time series 
  sequentially, without prior diagnosis of their behavior, providing good results.<sup>12,21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In most 
  time series of interest to Public Health, variability is largely attributable 
  to trends and seasonality. Their behavior is non-linear, and their cycles are 
  irregular. The advantage of using neural networks to approximate non-linear 
  functions is that this technique has been successful in analyzing series in 
  which the mathematical knowledge of the stochastic process behind the series 
  is either unknown, or difficult to be rationalized.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Neural networks 
  were developed initially as a strategy for simulating human mental processes 
  – such as image and sound recognition – and later as an efficient technological 
  instrument for performing a large number of different tasks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A neural 
  network is composed of neurons, or nodes, ant their connections, which may be 
  inputs or outputs with respect to each individual neuron. The node or neuron 
  is the site of mathematical processing. Such processing is divided into two 
  steps: the weighted addition of inputs (<font face="Symbol">S</font> W<sub>i</sub>X<sub>i</sub>) 
  and the submission the result to an activating function, which may generate 
  an input for other neurons. This function is usually a logistic function or 
  a hyperbolic tangent. Such functions are sigmoidal in shape, with very little 
  variation for extreme values of <i>x</i>, which simulates the saturation of 
  a biological neuron when incoming stimuli are too intense.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">ANNs may 
  be described as a strategy for the mathematical modeling of problems, which 
  are conceived as systems with inputs and outputs. Unlike in other modeling strategies, 
  one does not need to know the mathematical relationship between inputs and outputs. 
  Thus, unlike multiple regression, the ANN model does not require a function 
  to be proposed in advance,<sup>11</sup> since certain neural networks are capable 
  of approximating any function whatsoever. The network would therefore be able 
  to solve any problem whose relationships it can represent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Our aim 
  is to evaluate the appropriateness of the use of recurrent neural networks as 
  a predictive technique for time series in Public Health.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  was carried out during a cholera epidemic which took place in 1993 and 1994 
  in the state of Cear&aacute;, northeastern Brazil, and was based on excess deaths 
  with 'poorly defined intestinal infections' as the underlying cause (ICD-9).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Excess mortality 
  was attributed to non-diagnosed lethal cases of cholera.<sup>8</sup> Cear&aacute; 
  was chosen for having presented, for two consecutive years, the highest yearly 
  incidence rates of cholera ever registered in Brazil – namely 346.19 and 302.74 
  per 100,000 population, in 1993 and 1994, respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The monthly 
  number of deaths in the state of Cear&aacute; between 1979 and 1995 with "poorly-defined 
  intestinal infections" (ICD-9) as the underlying cause were obtained from the 
  Ministry of Health's Mortality Information System.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As a comparison 
  we chose negative binomial regression, a statistical technique widely employed 
  for this type of data in cases where Poisson regression proves inadequate.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A recurrent 
  network was built with two neurons in the input layer (corresponding to year 
  and month), twelve in the hidden layer, one in the output layer, and one in 
  the memory layer. The recurrent connection connects the output layer to the 
  memory layer, which, in its turn, is connected to the hidden layer. All activating 
  functions were based on the logistic function. Training was carried out through 
  backpropagation, with 0.01 learning rate and 0.9 momentum. The criterion for 
  training termination was reaching 22,000 epochs. NeuroShell<sup>&acirc;</sup> 
  software was used.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data from 
  January 1979 to June 1991 – totaling 150 observations – were used for network 
  training and model adjustment. This choice was aimed at ensuring the absence 
  of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> circulation in the adjustment period, given that the 
  first case notified in the state of Cear&aacute; took place in February 1992, 
  and non-detected cases may have occurred in the immediately preceding months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data for 
  the 54-month period between August 1991 and December 1995 were predicted based 
  on the network. Due to the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in January 1996, we chose 
  not to prolong the extrapolation beyond this date in order to ensure the homogeneity 
  of the series. The confidence interval for the implicit ANN model was estimated 
  based on the distribution of residues from the training period, assuming a normal 
  distribution with mean =0. Bootstrapping with 2,000 samples was performed in 
  order to evaluate the adequacy of the parameters directly estimated from the 
  150 residues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data were 
  also adjusted to a negative binomial distribution, deaths being a function of 
  order of occurrence, representing month-year, and of month of occurrence, transformed 
  into a dummy variable, representing the seasonal component, after verifying 
  an over-dispersion in a Poisson regression model. STATA<sup>19</sup> software 
  was used for this analysis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows the results of negative binomial regression. June was removed from 
  the model for colinearity reasons, i.e., according to the adjusted model, June 
  is the baseline month for the definition of the remaining parameters, which 
  express the seasonal component. The months between July and November were not 
  statistically significant, but were kept in the model to ensure its validity.</font></p>

  The mean difference between the two estimates was 0.544740 (95%CI -294971 to 
  4.039190). <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> presents estimates from both models 
  extrapolated for the July 1991 – December 1995 period. In this case there is 
  less agreement between both estimates, with a 0.92 Pearson correlation coefficient. 
  Mean difference is -6.56195 (95%CI -13.9088 to 0.784901). The estimate given 
  by the ANN is higher than that obtained through regression. Although ANN estimates 
  for the December – May period – the season with highest mortality – were closer 
  to the observed values, the values estimated through regression were closer 
  to the observed values in the remaining months.</font></p>

  the detection of the first cases of cholera in the state in February – and in 
  October-November 1992. From February 1993 onward, with the exception of August 
  and September 1994, all points were above the upper limit of the regression 
  model. Considering excess mortality as the difference between the number of 
  deaths observed and the upper limit of the confidence interval, the excess mortality 
  – as defined by regression – was 68 deaths in 1992, 266 in 1993, 285 in 1994, 
  and 205 in 1995.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The neural 
  network detected an excess mortality of only five deaths in December 1993, the 
  month preceding the highest peak in the cholera epidemic, and of 17 deaths in 
  November-December 1994, in the following season.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  obtained indicate that excess mortality did occur in the state of Cear&aacute; 
  in the period, and that it may be possible to detect this excess mortality based 
  on monthly mortality data. In the studied period, 217 deaths due to cholera 
  were registered in the state: 19 in 1992, 89 in 1993, 104 in 1994 and five in 
  1995. The neural network underestimated excess mortality. There are doubts concerning 
  the considerable magnitude of the binomial regression estimate for 1995. Such 
  magnitude may be due to the extended extrapolation period. Prolonging the series 
  to encompass the period immediately following would perhaps clear this point. 
  Unfortunately, the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 would cast doubts on the homogeneity 
  of the series, introducing a likely bias and hampering result interpretation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It should 
  be noted that, with respect to the season with the greatest number of deaths 
  ascribed to poorly defined intestinal infections, point estimates provided by 
  the neural network were closer to the observed values than those provided by 
  negative binomial regression in the extrapolation period (<a href="#fig2">Figure 
  2</a>), but not in the model-adjustment period (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), 
  suggesting that, for longer intervals, extrapolation through binomial regression 
  is less reliable than that provided by neural networks. This potential characteristic 
  of the neural network, however, is not advantageous, since interval estimation 
  has low levels of precision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Estimates 
  from both models showed good agreement, indicating the adequacy of using ANNs 
  for health-related time series. However, from a more pragmatic standpoint – 
  the usual approach in econometrics – the choice between different prediction 
  strategies must tend towards that which correctly predicts the outcome. In epidemiological 
  surveillance, the subject of the prediction is the detection of abnormal values<sup>20</sup> 
  rather than the greater proximity between predicted and observed numbers – which 
  is the case with price prediction, for instance. In the present case, negative 
  binomial regression was more adequate for the detection of excess deaths during 
  the circulation of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> due to its narrower variance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The difference 
  between negative binomial regression and Poisson regression resides in its estimation 
  of variance, which incorporates an over-dispersion parameter – alpha. This method 
  was used only because residues registered after adjustment of a Poisson regression 
  showed greater dispersion than their corresponding distributions. When alpha 
  equals zero, negative binomial distribution is reduced to Poisson distribution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Different 
  strategies have been used for error estimation in neural network predictions.<sup>2</sup> 
  The one used in the present study is based on the assumption that, theoretically, 
  an exact model for the time series can be found, but that, due to measurement 
  errors and to the influence of uncontrollable and unknown factors, there is 
  a randomly produced residual error, and the neural network is a quasi-optimal 
  model. This is doubtless an area to be further explored and developed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The neural 
  networks most used are the non-recurrent or feed-forward networks. In this model 
  each neuron in a given layer interacts with al neurons in adjacent layers, but 
  not with those in the same layer, processing occurring always in one direction, 
  from input to output. By contrast, recurrent neural networks, such as the one 
  employed in the present study, are capable of learning sequences and are thus 
  the best choice for dealing with time-series data. Whereas networks with standard 
  connections respond to a given input always through the same output, a recurrent 
  network can respond to a same input through different outputs at different moments, 
  depending on the input previously presented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When incorporating 
  a neuron into the memory layer, the network is incorporating an auto-regressive 
  component,<sup>22</sup> in addition to the trend and seasonality components 
  represented by the two input neurons, year and month. The auto-regressive component 
  allows the values predicted at a given moment to influence the subsequent prediction, 
  ascribing greater influence to recent values. This did not generate divergence 
  between models, despite the negative binomial regression not considering auto-correlation 
  in time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The main 
  difficulty faced in using neural networks is that, due to the novelty of the 
  method, researchers in general have little familiarity with the process, compared 
  to other statistical methods.<sup>14</sup> The criterion for choosing between 
  different networks is pragmatic, i.e., the network chosen is that which fulfils 
  the objectives expected. Result reproducibility is also not guaranteed, since 
  initial weights are random in each training session – which may lead to different 
  areas in the error surface –, and since there are different convergence criteria 
  – which may result in different local minimums. These characteristics contribute 
  towards a certain degree of uncertainty in using this instrument, which can 
  be overcome by carrying out several training sessions and observing result distribution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
  problem mentioned in the literature<sup>9</sup> is over-training, by which the 
  network captures quantitative relationships generated by noise from the data, 
  with negative effects on generalization (external validity). An alternative 
  is to compare networks with different training times.<sup>6,7</sup> The network 
  presented in the present study was the first one adjusted, no important differences 
  having been detected in subsequent networks. One may say that the criterion 
  for convergence was learning 'time', since convergence was determined by the 
  number of times the entire set of data was presented during training. The 'training 
  set' comprised the data from the period preceding the introduction of cholera 
  in the country. A separate calibration set was not determined, since the size 
  of the training set has important implications on generalization. In this case, 
  the calibration method – cross-validation – would not compensate for the reduction 
  in the size of the training set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  example, the neural network was less sensitive than negative binomial regression. 
  Its main advantage was the lower level of statistical knowledge required for 
  its application. It was clearly the technique most easily applicable in the 
  present example, since it did not imply the recognition of models according 
  to the behavior of the series, nor the evaluation of the adjusted model. The 
  present results indicate promising aspects in the use of neural networks in 
  epidemiological surveillance. However, there is still need for deepening theoretical 
  knowledge of the statistical behavior of network residues, so as to allow for 
  greater estimate precision.</font></p>
