<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b>To 
  evaluate the psychometric properties of the Oral Heath Impact Profile (OHIP-14) 
  to measure oral health in children.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>The OHIP-14 questionnaire was applied to 312 schoolchildren aged 12 years 
  residing in Sabar&aacute;, Brazil, in 2001. OHIP-14's reliability was evaluated 
  using Cronbach's alpha and correlation intraclass coefficient. For examining 
  content validity, Pearson's correlation and logistic regression analysis were 
  applied. For construct validity, Student's t-test and Tukey-Kramer test were 
  used.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Tooth loss among the subjects was low in this study (between 85% and 100%). 
  Caries prevalence was very low and not detectable in 59.0% of the sample. The 
  logistic regression model showed high predictive values for reporting treatment 
  need and intermediate values for dental caries perception. The comparison between 
  different OHIP average scores, according to the DMF-S index's three categories 
  of decayed, missing, filled surfaces, indicated significant difference only 
  for the categories social disability and deficit.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>The study results indicated that the adolescents did not report high prevalence 
  of oral conditions. The OHIP was associated with perceived treatment need, reporting 
  of dental caries and increased DMF-S index. These results suggest that the OHIP 
  has good psychometric properties when applied to children and could be a promising 
  instrument for screening priority care groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Indicators 
  associating oral conditions to individuals' quality of life have been developed 
  because of the need of understanding subjectively perceived health conditions 
  as well as determining the impact of health conditions on quality of life.<sup>6,19</sup> 
  The concept of perceived health need has arisen from the health promotion movement 
  started in 1974, when the notion of health was dissociated from absence of disease. 
  Health and disease have been then considered two distinct multidimensional entities 
  and thus not measurable in a linear unidimensional scale. Health has been defined 
  as a quality of life component.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among several 
  instruments that have been developed to measure perceived needs, the Oral Health 
  Impact Profile (OHIP) is most widely used in studies of people with different 
  cultural background and sociodemographic profile. The OHIP was developed to 
  provide a wide measurement of dysfunction, discomfort, and disability related 
  to oral conditions. This information adds up to conventional indicators of oral 
  epidemiology of clinical diseases providing thus a profile of "disease impact" 
  on people and the effectiveness of health services in reducing these impacts. 
  Originally, the OHIP comprises seven components and 49 items arranged in a questionnaire 
  format and a 5-choice Lickert-like scale ranging from never to often is used 
  in the answers. Data consolidation can be performed using a discrete scale or 
  by scoring each scale interval from 0 to 4.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Traditionally, 
  perceived need indicators have been designed for adults and elderly. Still, 
  Broder et al<sup>4</sup> (2000) have conducted a study among urban teenagers 
  of New Jersey, US, aged 12 to 14 years, comparing an objective indicator, DMF-T 
  index (index comprising the sum of decayed, missed and filled teeth) and two 
  subjective indicators (RAND-36-Item Health survey which measures general health 
  similarly to the OHIP and comprises eight health concepts – physical health 
  problems, role limitations caused by emotional or mental problems, energy/fatigue, 
  emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health perceptions 
  – and the OHIP-49). The authors noted that subjective indicators, OHIP in particular, 
  could be a valuable sensitive screening instrument for identifying those people 
  in a community under high impact of oral health conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The OHIP 
  has been designed in English for a particular cultural background. Hence, for 
  adapting the indicator into Portuguese and the Brazilian cultural background, 
  Almeida et al<sup>1</sup> (2001) carried out a two-step cross-cultural translation. 
  In the first step, the semantic validation of the cross-culturally translated 
  instrument was carried out piloting it among users of the Brazilian Unified 
  Health System's (SUS) health clinics from different age groups. In the second 
  step, the instrument's psychometric properties were tested in samples of adult 
  and elder populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since OHIP 
  semantic and psychometric validation had been carried out only in adult and 
  elder populations and had not been before assessed in children and adolescents, 
  this study aimed at evaluating OHIP psychometric properties in young people.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Secondary 
  data from an epidemiological survey conducted by the Sabar&aacute;'s Health 
  Department in 2001<a name="top1"></a><sup><a href="#back1">1</a></sup> was used. 
  The survey data had been collected through an informed decision process, researchers 
  had contacted all participants' parents who authorized their children to be 
  interviewed and the confidential report of findings. The utilization of the 
  present study data has been previously authorized by the municipality's Dentistry 
  Division and consisted of reports of oral caries examinations as well as questionnaires 
  on perceived need (OHIP-14) applied to 312 public school boys and girls aged 
  12 years old from seven different areas. Other OHIP studies found variation 
  coefficients (<font face="Symbol">d</font>/&#181;) ranging between 0.63 and 
  2.46 for dentate people and between 1.00 and 3.46 for edentulous people. In 
  order to detect a 15% difference in mean scores for a category with a variation 
  coefficient of 1.0, it was estimated that 251 people would be necessary for 
  a type I error equal to 0.05 and a type II error equal to 0.20.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A simplified 
  OHIP-14 questionnaire comprising 14 items was used as a measurement instrument. 
  OHIP reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass 
  correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC was used as an estimate of the total 
  variability given by the sum of the natural variability and the measurement 
  error variability.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Content 
  validity was evaluated through two global scores: perception of treatment need 
  and perception of dental caries. The correlation of OHIP with the global scores 
  was assessed through Pearson's linear correlation. Univariate logistic regression 
  analysis was applied to determine the association between the global scores, 
  considered independent variables, and OHIP components.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To evaluate 
  the construct's validity the sample was grouped according to the three categories 
  of the DMF-S index (measuring the sum of decayed, missing, and filled surfaces): 
  0 to 5, 6 to 10, and above 10. DMF-S 0 to 5 was set as reference for allowing 
  the comparing of the two other categories. A mean OHIP-14 was obtained for each 
  one of the three groups. Means were then compared using Student's t-test for 
  non-paired samples. Non-paired Student's t-test was applied to test the null 
  hypothesis that OHIP means of the studied groups were equal.<sup>2,3</sup> The 
  Tukey-Kramer test was also used for different size groups for allowing multiple 
  comparisons (simultaneous inferences), particularly for all comparisons among 
  DMF-S groups.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To assess 
  item redundancy for each OHIP component a Kendall's non-parametric ordinal correlation 
  analysis was carried out.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  sample consisted mostly of females (160; 51.3%). When evaluated for a global 
  subjective score, most (171; 55.5%) reported they needed oral treatment. Regarding 
  their perception of dental caries, when asked, "do you think you have any cavities?", 
  almost half were positive (124; 46.1%). This outcome had a high concordance 
  with the occurrence of dental caries measured by both the DMF-S (45.2%) and 
  DMF-T (41.01%) indexes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  of Cronbach's alpha coefficient were considered low ranging from 0.55 to 0.26.

  ICC was similar to Cronbach's alpha.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Pearson's 
  test between OHIP components and reported perception of oral treatment revealed 
  a positive though weak correction, ranging between 0.156 and 0.278. The difference 
  between mean scores of each OHIP subscale, divided into those subjects reporting 
  they needed treatment and those reporting did not need treatment, was significant 
  only for the components pain, psychological discomfort, and psychological disability. 
  The odds ratio ranged between 1.208 and 1.564, i.e., subjects who reported pain 
  in the OHIP were about 1.5 times more likely to report treatment need when compared 
  to subjects who did not report pain in the OHIP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data relating 
  to each component were disposed into 2x2 tables where the lines show the two 
  classifications of predictive variables, perception of treatment need and perception 
  of having cavities and OHIP components. As the classifications were independent, 
  odds ratio was calculated using the following equation:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">OR = (a*d) 
  / (b*c)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Odds ratio 
  yielded point and interval values indicating the likelihood of a group of experiencing 
  impacts when compared to other group (perception of treatment need and perception 
  of having dental caries).</font></p>

  1.113 and 1.549. There were recorded two global perceptions regarding the subjects' 
  oral health: need of oral treatment and perception of dental caries.</font></p>

  the variable DMF-S 0 to 5 had a significant difference when compared to the 
  variable DMF-S above 10. All other comparisons were not significant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  sample consisted of 312 children aged 12 years from public schools in the municipality 
  of Sabar&aacute;, Brazil. The original study<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  with an active search had a high global response rate that varied per item studied. 
  Regarding length of residency, missed answers were only 4.0% while for perception 
  of treatment need 26.0% were either "do not know" or not answered. There was 
  a higher response compared to 75% response rate reported for a questionnaire 
  sent by mail by Slade et al<sup>13</sup> (1995), 57.6% by Hunt et al<sup>7</sup> 
  (1995), and 74.4% by Slade et al<sup>15</sup> (1996). These authors also noted 
  that after reviewing several studies they found a response rate between 71% 
  and 86% for the OHIP sent by mail. The average response rate was better than 
  86.8% reported by Miotto &amp; Barcellos<sup>11</sup> (2001), and similar to 
  94.92% by Silva<sup>12</sup> (2001), both adopting the same search strategy 
  as the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">OHIP-14 
  reliability was assessed through the internal consistency method of coefficient 
  correlation using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The measured reliability was 
  low to moderate. Similar intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were obtained 
  though they were systematically lower when compared to Cronbach's alpha coefficients. 
  These results were lower to those previously reported by Slade &amp; Spencer<sup>16</sup> 
  (1994) who obtained Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging between 0.70 and 0.83 
  for six subscales and similar to 0.37 obtained in the deficit subscale. The 
  present study showed lower results than those previously reported by Slade &amp; 
  Spencer<sup>17</sup> (1994) that were between 0.42 and 0.77 for six subscales, 
  and higher than 0.08 for social disability. These findings are lower than those 
  reported by Locker &amp; Slade<sup>9</sup> (1993) who found values ranging between 
  0.80 and 0.90 for all components. They are also lower than 0.96 Cronbach's alpha 
  coefficient obtained by Slade et al<sup>15</sup> (1996) and 0.88 obtained by 
  Slade<sup>19</sup> (1997). Silva<sup>12</sup> (2001) described an internal consistency 
  measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranging between 0.6138 for psychological 
  disability and 0.7720 for psychological discomfort assessed using the simple 
  intraclass correlation coefficient. The obtained values ranged from 0.4427 for 
  psychological disability to 0.6292 for psychological discomfort.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Some of 
  the following factors could have contributed to the study results: method used, 
  cross-cultural translation, fewer items in the questionnaire, and respondents' 
  various schooling. Slade et al<sup>13</sup> (1995) reported that when a standard 
  interview was applied instead of a questionnaire sent by mail, OHIP-49 showed 
  a lower internal consistency. Slade<sup>19</sup> (1997) noted that in studies 
  where the OHIP had been translated into other languages such as French and Spanish, 
  some questions and categories could not be properly translated and thus affecting 
  the instrument's reliability. In the OHIP-14's cross-cultural translation process, 
  difficulties were reported concerning the translation of some terms into Portuguese.<sup>1</sup> 
  Shortening the number of OHIP-49 items which gave rise to the OHIP-14 could 
  have contributed to the instrument's lower reliability. In the OHIP-14 study, 
  most result comparisons were carried out using the complete instrument. A general 
  psychometry principle states that "the lower the number of items the lower the 
  scale consistency". The OHIP-14 has a third less items than the original instrument, 
  which could explain the low reliability seen in the present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Aiming at 
  assessing whether there were potential redundancies in the questionnaire, internal 
  correlations of OHIP items for each component were conducted. The Kendall's 
  correlation showed concordance among the items, i.e., the OHIP-14 items captured 
  different aspects including the contents of each component.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Pearson's 
  test between OHIP components and reported perception of oral treatment yielded 
  a positive though very weak correlation. However, the difference between mean 
  scores of each OHIP subscale, divided into subjects who reported treatment need 
  and those reporting dental caries, was statistically significant for pain, psychological 
  discomfort, and psychological disability. The odds ratio showed that subjects 
  who reported pain in the OHIP were about 1.5 times more likely to report treatment 
  need when compared to those who did not report pain. This finding suggests the 
  good validity of OHIP's contents concerning the global indicator of reported 
  perception of oral treatment need.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the analysis 
  of predictability using a logistic model, the likelihood of a subject to report 
  pain as well as oral treatment need was high, suggesting a good validity of 
  OHIP's content to predict the need for oral treatment. This finding shows that 
  the OHIP has a good predictive value for reporting oral treatment need and the 
  component pain had the highest predictive value.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The correlation 
  analysis between OHIP components and the reported perception of dental caries 
  also showed a positive though weak correlation. Despite that, the difference 
  between mean scores and odds ratios of each OHIP subscale, divided into subjects 
  who reported having dental caries and those who reported not having caries, 
  was significant for all components.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The predictive 
  logistic model applied to determine the effect of reporting in an OHIP component 
  as well as reporting dental caries was moderate to low, indicating a moderate 
  content validity of OHIP to predict the reported dental caries. These results 
  indicate that, as expected for this age group, while reported pain had the highest 
  predictive value of perception of dental caries, the predictive value of a positive 
  reporting in the OHIP was only moderate for perceived caries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To assess 
  validity properties of the OHIP's construct the DMF-S index was divided into 
  three categories: 0 to 5; 6 to 10; above 10. The comparison between different 
  mean OHIP scores, according to the DMF-S categories and using ANOVA, showed 
  a significant difference concerning social disability and deficit. In order 
  to determine the categories in which differences were seen, the Tukey's test 
  was used and a significant difference was found only in the ends of DMF-S for 
  social disability and deficit. These results are similar to those reported by 
  Slade &amp; Spencer<sup>17</sup> (1994), who found high impact in patients showing 
  high values in objective indicators. They also corroborate what found Coates 
  et al<sup>5</sup> (1996) that HIV-positive patients who had many oral conditions 
  reported a significant high impact. Moreover, they confirm the findings of Slade 
  et al<sup>14</sup> (1997) that oral conditions such as missing teeth, retained 
  root fragments, and periodontal pockets among others were associated with high 
  impact. It also partially corroborates Locker &amp; Jokovic<sup>8</sup> (1996) 
  study when no significant association between subjective and objective indicators 
  was found. Also, it agrees with Slade's<sup>19</sup> (1997) research showing 
  that higher OHIP scores were seen in individuals with less favorable oral-medical 
  conditions (more missing teeth, more root fragments, more untreated caries, 
  deeper periodontal pockets, and more periodontal recesses).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  significance verified only in three components contrasts with the results reported 
  by Broder et al<sup>4</sup> (2000), who found a significant difference for all 
  OHIP components while evaluating adolescents. Most probably this difference 
  could be due the different epidemiological profile of the studied groups in 
  Sabar&aacute; and New Jersey. While in Sabar&aacute; the mean DMF-S was 2.24 
  and 54.8% of the sample had DMF-S zero, in New Jersey the mean DMF-S was 8.8 
  and only 5% of the sample was DMF-S zero. As the frequency of individuals with 
  DMF-S above 10 was very low in the present study, the statistical power of the 
  sample was affected for rejecting the null hypothesis in some components. Overall, 
  the frequencies found in the OHIP were much lower than those reported in other 
  studies, including among adolescents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  results indicate that the prevalence of perceived dysfunction, discomfort and 
  disability as an impact resulting of oral health conditions in children aged 
  12 years in Sabar&aacute;, measured using the OHIP-14 instrument, was very low. 
  The study results allow for reaching the conclusion that the OHIP instrument 
  has good content validity for selecting groups of patients who perceive treatment 
  need and only moderate validity for identifying patients reporting dental caries. 
  The OHIP-14 has good criteria validity for the components social disability, 
  deficit, and psychological disability when comparing the association of the 
  instrument's scores with DMF-S index.</font></p>
