<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Lack of knowledge is one of the factors responsible for the persistence 
  of infectious diseases in Brazil. This study had the objective of developing, 
  implementing and evaluating a low-cost educational program using schistosomiasis 
  patients as a model.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>This was a descriptive study developed using a population of healthy people 
  (group 1) and schistosomiasis patients (groups 2 and 3), with 20 individuals 
  in each group. Teaching material (illustrated manual and album of leaflets) 
  and a questionnaire consisting of 17 questions to evaluate the groups' knowledge 
  were devised. The questionnaire was applied to groups 1 and 2 before and to 
  group 3 after the educational program. The variables studied were the educational 
  program, level of schooling, age, clinical form of schistosomiasis, symptoms, 
  and the subject's performance when answering the questionnaire. For the statistical 
  analysis, Fisher's exact test and variance analysis with one fixed factor were 
  utilized.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>The educational program was evaluated in the form of four topics: cycle, 
  clinical presentation, treatment and prevention of the disease. The median number 
  of correct responses to the questionnaire was higher for group 3 than for groups 
  1 and 2, for all the topics dealt with. This median was also higher for group 
  2 than for group 1, for all topics except for the item "prevention".<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>The educational process applied was efficient and improved the knowledge 
  of the disease. It may provide an effective low-cost methodological model that 
  can also be applied to combating other endemic diseases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Schistosomiasis 
  is a serious public health problem. Around the world, more than 200 million 
  people are infected by it, of whom 10 million are in Brazil, with 6 to 8 million 
  in the country's northeastern region.<sup>12</sup> The disease was introduced 
  to Brazil through the slave trade in the seventeenth century, in which Africans 
  were brought in, to work in the sugar cane plantations of the northeast.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 
  factors that have contributed towards the propagation of schistosomiasis are 
  migratory movements, inadequate exploitation of water resources, the widespread 
  distribution of intermediate hosts, the longevity of the disease, and the lack 
  of sanitary education. The agent, intermediate host, transmission mechanism 
  and the treatment for the disease and the water are known, but this knowledge 
  is not shared by part of the population, especially among people who now live 
  outside of the endemic areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, 
  such people return to the endemic areas with a certain frequency, even if only 
  for short periods. Coura-Filho<sup>5</sup> has shown in Minas Gerais that, even 
  after two centuries of contact with the disease, the community was unaware of 
  the role of water in the transmission of schistosomiasis. Only a very small 
  percentage of the population in that study (4.6%) attributed a role to bathing 
  and washing clothes in the river, in the transmission of the disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Chemotherapy 
  in the treatment of schistosomiasis in areas of high prevalence has not had 
  long-lasting success. There has been rapid reinfection, which reinforces the 
  need for knowledge of the disease among the population.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Education 
  is an essential component of nursing attendance in the field of community health. 
  Its aim is the promotion, maintenance and restoration of health, and the adaptation 
  to the residual effects of diseases. Experience from a specialized multidisciplinary 
  service attending schistosomiasis outpatients<sup><a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1">1</a></sup> 
  has shown that such patients mostly come from endemic regions. This experience 
  acquired while conducting nursing consultations has led to consideration of 
  what effect the utilization of educational actions would have. The presupposition 
  would be that the greater the knowledge of the disease were, the greater the 
  adherence to treatment might be (including monitoring the cure), and the lower 
  the rates of reinfection and evolution to more severe forms of the disease would 
  be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of the present study was therefore to develop, implement and evaluate an educational 
  program regarding schistosomiasis aimed at outpatients. Such an experience could 
  contribute towards redirecting the actions within the primary healthcare level. 
  Furthermore, such study utilizing scientific methodologies would allow an assessment 
  to be made of situations in which improvements in quality of life, human satisfaction 
  and social behavior are observed, among other changes that form objectives in 
  healthcare promotion.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sample</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This was 
  a descriptive study developed within the schistosomiasis outpatient service 
  of the Discipline of Gastroenterology of the Federal University of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo. It was performed after approval of the study protocol by the Research 
  Ethics Committee of Unifesp (n. 154/01).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample 
  was formed by three groups, all of whom were aged over 18 years and had given 
  their informed consent for their participation. Group 1 was composed of healthy 
  people without connection with the outpatient service, while groups 2 and 3 
  were selected sequentially from among the patients who, upon receiving attendance, 
  had not yet participated in the program. For group 3, cancellation of their 
  registration with the outpatient service was considered to be an exclusion criterion. 
  Since the patients were selected sequentially, individuals with both the mild 
  and severe chronic forms of schistosomiasis were included, considering their 
  clinical, echographic and endoscopic characteristics. Since the clinical form 
  could possibly have an influence on the responses to the questionnaire, we evaluated 
  the specific and non-specific signs and symptoms of the disease in the two groups 
  (groups 2 and 3).<sup>3, 11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The groups 
  were formed as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"> Group 
      1 (control): made up of 20 people (thirteen originating from the city of 
      S&atilde;o Paulo, six from the State of Bahia and one from the city of Rio 
      de Janeiro), without any epidemiological history of schistosomiasis or connection 
      with the outpatient service. This group did not participate in the educational 
      program and just had the questionnaire applied.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Group 
      2: made up of 20 people (nine originating from Bahia, one from Pernambuco, 
      six from Minas Gerais and three from Alagoas) with a diagnosis of the chronic 
      form of schistosomiasis, selected sequentially from among the outpatients 
      who had not yet participated in any educational program. The questionnaire 
      was applied to this group before it participated in the educational program.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Group 
      3: made up of 20 people (nine originating from Bahia, three from Pernambuco, 
      three from Minas Gerais, one from Para&iacute;ba, two from Alagoas and one 
      from Sergipe) with a diagnosis of the chronic form of schistosomiasis. The 
      questionnaire was applied to this group after it participated in the educational 
      program. The delay in applying the questionnaire enabled assessment of how 
      well the knowledge transmitted had been assimilated.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most of 
  the individuals in groups 2 and 3 had been living in the city of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo for at least ten years, although they were periodically visiting relatives 
  in the endemic areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The variables 
  studied were the individuals' participation or not in the educational program, 
  performance in the program (if they had participated), level of schooling, age 
  (number of completed years), clinical form of schistosomiasis and symptomatology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Educational 
  program</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The educational 
  program was accomplished in groups, in which the educator directed the subject 
  in accordance with the participants' interests and each person's experience, 
  and stimulated an exchange of experiences. With the aim of catching participants' 
  attention in presenting the program, an album<a name="top2"></a><sup><a href="#back1">2</a></sup> 
  of leaflets was devised, with illustrations on the cycle, clinical presentation, 
  treatment and prevention of the disease. This album consists of 29 sheets and 
  substitutes for the use of projection slides, which therefore allows the program 
  to be undertaken in places without electricity. A manual<a name="top2"></a><sup><a href="#back1">2</a></sup> 
  was also prepared for distribution at the end of the program with the aim of 
  contributing towards disseminating the knowledge. The language utilized is simple 
  and the illustrations reinforce the teaching of each topic dealt with. Figure 
  gives an example of the illustrations and text of this teaching material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To assess 
  the groups' knowledge regarding the disease, a two-part questionnaire was devised. 
  The first part of this instrument asks for data to characterize the individual, 
  and the second part contains 17 multiple-choice questions on the main characteristics 
  of the disease. For some questions, more than one correct answer is accepted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The questions 
  deal with five aspects of the disease: its cycle (questions 1 to 5), clinical 
  presentation (questions 6 to 10), treatment (questions 11 to 14) and prevention 
  (questions 15 to 17). A test was made on the original questionnaire that preceded 
  the definitive version, using individuals who were not included in this study. 
  During the test phase, we observed that the questions involving long statement 
  needed to be repeated one or more times, since when we reached the end of the 
  sentence, the interviewee had forgotten the beginning. The test allowed us to 
  make corrections and put the questions into language that was simple, direct 
  and easily understood by the interviewee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The instructions 
  on how to answer the questionnaire were given orally a few minutes before the 
  individual interview applied by the researcher. The manner of applying the questionnaire 
  placed the literate and illiterate interviewees on the same level, because the 
  questions were read out and the responses were noted down by the interviewer, 
  after giving the explanations.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The questionnaire 
  was applied to the three groups studied over a four-month period (May to August 
  2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The team 
  that took part in drawing up and evaluating the educational program was formed 
  by the head of the outpatient service (a senior professor in the Discipline 
  of Gastroenterology), a doctor doing doctoral level postgraduate research, three 
  nurses doing master's level postgraduate research, three medical residents, 
  four specialized doctors, three students on the nursing course (monitors), and 
  fifth-year students on the medicine course. The presentational part of the educational 
  program was given by a nursing monitor accompanied by a qualified nurse. This 
  presentation was previously standardized at meetings of the team, to guarantee 
  homogeneity of the information transmitted to the participants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The educational 
  program had the following characteristics. First, there was a presentation lasting 
  for 20 to 30 minutes for a group of maximum of ten people. Following this, the 
  teaching strategy utilized was the stimulation of group participation and the 
  exchange of experiences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Independent 
  of interviewees' level of schooling, all questions and their possible responses 
  were read out to each group of interviewees. Participants then verbally chose 
  the alternative(s) that in their opinions were correct, and the researcher noted 
  down the response(s) chosen. The response was considered wrong when, in addition 
  to choosing a correct alternative, the interviewee chose one or more wrong responses. 
  The performance was evaluated by means of the number of correct responses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Statistical 
  analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between the level of schooling, clinical form of schistosomiasis, presence of 
  symptoms and responses of the groups in relation to the cycle, clinical presentation, 
  treatment and prevention of the disease were evaluated via Fisher's exact test. 
  The groups were compared with regard to age by using variance analysis with 
  a fixed factor. The median of the percentage of correct responses on each topic 
  dealt with in the questionnaire was also calculated for each group.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was found 
  that group 1 (median age of 24.5 years) was younger (p=0.029), with a larger 
  proportion of individuals (45%) in the age group from 21 to 30 years than in 
  group 2 (median age of 36 years) and group 3 (median age of 41.5 years). In 
  groups 2 and 3, the greatest proportion of individuals (60%) was in the age 
  group from 31 to 50 years, and these groups did not differ from each other (p=0.438). 
  With regard to gender, there was a predominance of women in the three groups 
  (group 1, 70%; group 2, 80%; and group 3, 55%), which did not differ from each 
  other in this respect (p=0.272). With regard to marital status (p=0.003), there 
  was a predominance of married people in group 3 (85%), in relation to groups 
  1 (55%) and 2 (35%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows that group 1 had a higher level of schooling (p&lt;0.001) than the 
  other groups. No individual in groups 2 and 3 had tertiary-level education and 
  the illiteracy rates in these groups were, respectively, 15 and 30%, percentages 
  that did not statistically differ from each other (p=0.438).</font></p>

  2</a> shows that the majority of the individuals in group 2 had the mild form 
  of schistosomiasis, while those in group 3 had the severe form (p=0.001). Despite 
  this distribution, <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a> shows that there was no statistical 
  difference (p=0.333) with regard to the presence or absence of symptoms, between 
  groups 2 and 3. The signs and symptoms considered were the ones that could be 
  more specifically associated with the disease (anemia, hematemesis, melena and 
  ascites), and not the less specific symptoms (diarrhea, intestinal constipation, 
  vomiting, headache and weight loss). In group 1, there was no report of the 
  presence of these symptoms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  work, illustrated teaching material on schistosomiasis was developed to attend 
  to the educational needs of a population of children and adults, bearing in 
  mind their illiteracy rate and low level of schooling. In fact, in the population 
  we studied, the illiteracy rate was 30% in group 3 and 15% in group 2. In group 
  1, despite the greater level of schooling, the grasping of concepts was no better 
  than in group 3. The lack of teaching material regarding schistosomiasis that 
  could enliven and motivate such classes, to generate interest and participation 
  among the students, has already been reported by other authors.<sup>9</sup> 
  The relationships between the disease and illiteracy, migratory flow and lower 
  purchasing power have also become known.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Schall et 
  al<sup>9</sup> devised teaching material based on a text of literary style and 
  applied this in elementary schools in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. It 
  was shown to be efficacious in promoting the learning of concepts and basic 
  care in relation to schistosomiasis. This type of approach would not have been 
  appropriate for the characteristics of the population we attended, because of 
  the low level of schooling and high illiteracy rate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Santos et 
  al<sup>7</sup> developed and applied an educational game about transmittable 
  diseases (schistosomiasis, Aids, dengue and leishmaniasis). They called the 
  game "<i>bate-boca</i>" ("disputes") and applied it among pre-adolescents and 
  adolescents with an average age of 15 to 16 years. The game helped significantly 
  in the comprehension of the concept, transmission, control, symptoms and treatment 
  of the diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The album 
  of leaflets that we developed has the format of a panel, which makes it possible 
  to utilize it in locations without electricity. This strategy showed itself 
  to be efficacious in rural areas.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A study 
  on schistosomiasis was carried out in public elementary schools on the periphery 
  of Belo Horizonte to assess the impact of an educational program regarding knowledge 
  of the disease.<sup>8</sup> For this, a questionnaire was applied and a feces 
  test for parasitic protozoa was performed before the educational program and 
  one year afterwards. Over this one-year interval, the knowledge of the disease 
  increased significantly. A decline from 12.9% to 9% was observed for the average 
  prevalence of the disease (estimated from the feces test for parasitic protozoa). 
  Four schools were surveyed, and in one of them the decrease was from 19.5% to 
  10.2%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Barreto<sup>2</sup> 
  also utilized a questionnaire listing risk factors related to schistosomiasis 
  when screening for <i>S. mansoni</i> infection among children aged 12 to 14 
  years in the municipality of Santo Ant&ocirc;nio de Jesus, in Bahia. The questionnaire 
  was made up of two parts (family conditions and the child's conditions) and 
  inquired into the type and frequency of contact activity with water, migration 
  and reports of <i>S. mansoni</i> infection in the past and present. The protozoan 
  parasitology of the feces was utilized in the validation of the variables. The 
  results showed that the discrimination power of the questionnaire increased 
  when variables were associated. In this author's opinion, one of the great advantages 
  of questionnaires is the low cost of implementing them, since there is no need 
  for highly specialized equipment or personnel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">None of 
  the works cited contained questions that dealt with schistosomiasis as a whole 
  (the cycle, clinical presentation, treatment and prevention). Furthermore, the 
  programs described in the literature are not available. In these studies, analysis 
  of the responses regarding the disease cycle showed that, in a general manner, 
  the patients knew that water was involved in the transmission of the disease. 
  Rivers and reservoirs were cited as important sources of contamination; on the 
  other hand, so were the water in toilet bowls and swimming pools. A study developed 
  among the population of the municipality of Cachoeirinha (Rec&ocirc;ncavo Baiano)<sup>1</sup> 
  found that these people did not have much information about the schistosomiasis 
  cycle, nor did they make any distinction between this and other parasitic worm 
  diseases. According to some interviewees, it was not the river where they fished 
  that the worms came from, but the domestic water, in which some residues were 
  visible to the naked eye ("some little red balls").</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, the best known test for diagnosing schistosomiasis was the feces test, 
  rather than rectal biopsies. What may have contributed to this is the fact that 
  only the people with the disease would go through the situation of being submitted 
  to rectal biopsy as well as feces tests since, in accordance with the protocol 
  under which the study was performed, if the individual was not submitted to 
  rectal biopsy during the diagnosis of the disease, he would be during the phase 
  of checking the cure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the question 
  dealing with clinical complaints, the alternatives most cited were the absence 
  of symptoms and the emergence of a clinical condition years later. On the other 
  hand, the signs and symptoms of the severe form were not so well known. Some 
  of the patients with schistosomiasis said that they had found out that they 
  had it by chance, when they went to do periodical tests required for their work 
  or, among the women, at prenatal examinations.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to the treatment of schistosomiasis, even though some people had passed through 
  processes of cure and checkup, they had not acquired knowledge that they could 
  transmit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In discussing 
  prevention, we reinforced how important it was for patients to avoid contact 
  with contaminated water, since this could infect them again. We sought to make 
  our patients aware that prevention is important both for healthy individuals 
  and for sick people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In a general 
  manner, the results revealed a notable lack of knowledge among the interviewees 
  regarding the disease. Group 3 (patients with schistosomiasis who participated 
  in the educational program) presented better performance than groups 1 (control) 
  and 2 (patients with schistosomiasis who did not participate in the educational 
  program). Since the questionnaire was applied to patients living outside of 
  the endemic zone, there is a need for it to be validated among patients living 
  in such regions and exposed to the risk of acquiring the disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The educational 
  process applied to this population was efficient, since it improved these people's 
  knowledge of the disease. It thus forms a model for effective low-cost action 
  that could also be applied in the combat of other endemic diseases that exist 
  within this country.</font></p>
