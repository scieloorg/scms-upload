<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To investigate how houseplant 'caretakers' represent the relationship between 
  plant vases and breeding sites for the dengue vector, in order to reformulate 
  educational policies.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The present study was carried out among caretakers from three 
  S&atilde;o Paulo State municipalities in which dengue is known to exist and 
  in which extensive educational activities had been previously conducted. Twenty 
  households from each of the municipalities studied were selected based on larval 
  density evaluation bulletins elaborated by SUCEN (Endemic Disease Control Coordination) 
  and classified as positive or negative for the presence of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> 
  larvae in plant vases. The 60 participants were aged 20-65 years and were directly 
  involved in plant care. Interviews were carried out using a semi-structured 
  questionnaire, and recorded in cassette tapes. Data were tabulated using the 
  collective subject discourse technique.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Negative representations found included: erroneous information in the population's 
  imaginary universe; disbelief that a 'tiny little mosquito' could cause such 
  extensive problems; belief in the disease only after its concrete manifestation; 
  and mistrust in educational activities in general. Positive representations 
  included: understanding of the basic mechanism of dengue transmission; appreciation 
  of the role and constant presence of sanitary authorities; understanding of 
  their own share of responsibility in fighting the disease.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>With respect to vector control activities, the exceedingly synthetic messages 
  emitted by the sanitary authorities prevent the information from being assimilated 
  by the population to the desirable extent. Educational activities must be understood 
  by the population to which they are destined if any behavioral changes are to 
  take place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A rapid 
  expansion of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> vector, especially in the North and Northeast 
  regions of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, has been taking 
  place since 1985. The first outbreak of the disease took place in 1987, when 
  a small number of cases were observed in the municipality of Ara&ccedil;atuba. 
  In late 1990/early 1991, a dengue epidemic was registered in Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto, which expanded into neighboring municipalities, totaling over six thousand 
  cases of dengue confirmed by laboratory testing.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the following 
  years, transmission spread to other regions of S&atilde;o Paulo State, but with 
  a further drawback: in addition to the circulation of dengue serotype 1, serotype 
  2 was also isolated.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Vector biology 
  and studies of its behavior indicate that immature forms of <i>A.aegypti</i> 
  can inhabit a wide range of vessels, providing they contain a minimum amount 
  of water. This water may be supplied either by rain or, especially, by the actions 
  of humans in their environment. Thus, the maintenance and spread of <i>A.aegypti</i> 
  in the environment is closely related to human living habits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Contemporary 
  Brazilian society has been under the influence of accelerated urbanization, 
  pollution, environmental degradation, and deficiencies in urban infrastructure, 
  sanitation, and education, promoted by an economic model that prevents access 
  to a better quality of life for most citizens. When combined with the dengue 
  issue, this can generate undesirable consequences for modern urban life. Therefore, 
  society as a whole – and not only the public sphere – must engage in dengue 
  control. In public health, little, if anything, can be done with out the participation 
  of society.<sup>5</sup> By participation we mean not only the incorporation 
  of the dengue prevention program by society in general, but also by the different 
  sectors of society responsible for the production and commercialization of products 
  that may become breeding sites for the mosquito.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  context, the goals established for the educational component of dengue vector 
  control programs in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo reinforce this idea; however, 
  the actions taken show greater focus on chemically combating the vector, perhaps 
  due to greater reliance on its efficacy for environmental management.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The educational 
  actions initially implemented had a more immediate character. These actions 
  attempted to encourage the population to adopt the instructions given as a model 
  for a change of behavior. The educational component of the dengue control program 
  hinted towards greater effectiveness when program municipalization advanced 
  in mid 1997, assuming an execution which was closer to local realities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The messages 
  produced, however, maintained the same focus as before. Only slight nuances 
  suggested a greater participation of the community in policy making, favoring 
  local reality, and with systematically higher frequency. Despite these efforts, 
  the educational component had little effect on the outcomes of entomological 
  surveys. Furthermore, when analyzed from the execution standpoint, educational 
  actions – still based on cleaning campaigns, distribution of printed material, 
  and broadcasting of information about the vector – were not sufficient to promote 
  changes in behavior, nor were they able to generate genuine community participation.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  hypotheses raised in the present study is that the educational campaigns and 
  the messages they conveyed, based &#150; even though not always consciously 
  &#150; on the traditional approach, conventionally termed 'transmission pedagogy', 
  did not allow, precisely because of the pedagogical option adopted, for the 
  establishment of an effective code-sharing dialogue relationship between sanitary 
  and common-sense reasoning, a necessary condition for the educational action 
  to have an impact on behavioral change. In this context, educational messages 
  tend to convey abstract meanings, not significantly in touch with the receptors' 
  everyday life. Hence, it becomes difficult for receptors to incorporate the 
  meanings intended by sanitary authorities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, as 
  an attempt to better understand the impact of such messages and their incorporation 
  (or lack of such) by the population in the past few years, we undertook the 
  development of a qualitative research project<sup>4</sup> aimed at assessing 
  the level of understanding of dengue among affected populations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Emphasis 
  was placed on plant vases because vector biology studies, and the results of 
  larval density evaluations indicate that <i>A.aegypti</i> is frequently found 
  in artificial vessels kept full with water by the population. These are classified 
  as either serviceable or unserviceable (tires, plant vases, cans, animal drinkers, 
  water tanks, etc.).<sup>2</sup> In the selected areas – which share certain 
  socioeconomic and demographical characteristics –, entomological indicators 
  point towards a high incidence of <i>A.aegypti</i> in these vessels. The 'plant 
  vase' category included all possible types of plant maintenance, such as: aquatic 
  plants or plants cultivated in water, ornamental vases, <i>xaxim</i> (fern-trunk 
  vase) plates, vase drippers, etc.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This study 
  portrays the level of understanding by affected populations of the relationship 
  between dengue and plant vases through their Social Representations. Three upstate 
  Sao Paulo municipalities were selected, namely Votuporanga, in the northeastern 
  region, Salto in the Southeast of the state and Bebedouro in the West Central 
  Area. In some, the infestation by <i>A.aegypti</i> was an older phenomenon whereas 
  in others it was more recent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty households 
  from each of the three study municipalities were selected. Households were classified 
  as positive or non-positive for a <i>A.aegypti</i> Larvae in plant vases. The 
  addresses of these households were removed from the evaluation bulletins used 
  by Sucen (<i>Superintend&ecirc;ncia de Controle de Endemias</i> – Endemic Disease 
  Control Coordination) for vector infestation measurement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The 60 subjects 
  (20 from each municipality) included in the survey were aged 20-65 years, predominantly 
  female, and were directly involved in plant care. Since this is an exploratory 
  study, the number of subjects was arbitrarily determined. This determination 
  was based on the saturation of the representations present in the reports collected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews 
  were conducted between 1 and 15 September 2000, by means of semi-structured 
  interviews comprising seven questions related to our project. Questions were 
  pre-tested and amended where necessary. The interview took place at the subject's 
  home. With the subject's consent, interviews were recorded in cassette tapes 
  and subsequently transcribed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Interview 
  data tabulation was carried out using the collective subject discourse technique,<sup>7</sup> 
  a set of procedures for the tabulation and organization of discourse data of 
  verbal nature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This technique 
  consists of selecting, from each individual answer given to a question, <i>key 
  expressions</i> representing the most significant sections of the answer provided. 
  To the key expressions correspond <i>central ideas</i>, which are the synthesis 
  of the discursive content manifested in them. With the material provided by 
  key expressions of similar central ideas, synthetic discourses, based on a variable 
  number of participants, are constructed in first person singular. This is designated 
  the <i>collective subject discourse</i> (CSD), in which the ideas of a group 
  or collectivity are represented as an individual discourse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The CSD 
  is a methodological tool designed to render social representations more clear 
  and expressive, allowing a given social group to be seen as the author and emitter 
  of discourses shared among group members.<sup>6</sup> With the collective subject 
  technique, we attempt to reconstruct as many synthetic discourses as deemed 
  necessary for expressing a given idea or a social representation of a phenomenon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">We chose 
  to tabulate the data collected in the three cities as a single group, since 
  no differences were detected in terms of the social representation of the studied 
  subject between the different cities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With respect 
  to presentation, we chose to present the <i>results</i> and the <i>discussion</i> 
  separately, since the CSD technique is based, among other things, on the opposition 
  between the <i>discourse of</i> reality and the <i>discourse about</i> reality;<sup>8</sup> 
  thus, in the RESULTS section, the author seeks to recover the <i>discourse of 
  reality</i>, whereas the Discussion section is reserved for the author's meta-linguistic 
  <i>discourse about reality</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects' 
  answers were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. <i>Central ideas</i> and CSDs 
  were obtained. The five questions considered as most important will be analyzed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Question 
  1 – "<i>Tell me a little about dengue. What do you know about it</i>?"</b></font></p>

  subject discourse I: <i>What I know about dengue is that dengue is a mosquito 
  that bites and transmits disease. It is a disease contracted or caused by the</i> 
  Aedes aegypti <i>mosquito. So, it's the transmission of the mosquito, that mosquito, 
  I don't know how to explain the disease clearly, but I know that it's through 
  this mosquito that the disease is transmitted.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central 
  Idea II <i>– Dengue is a sad and serious disease, that can be fatal</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Collective 
  subject discourse II: <i>It's a sad disease. Everybody I know who has had it 
  says it's difficult and fatal because it can kill: it's serious business. I 
  don't know much, I know that it's a disease that, I don't know, can kill you; 
  it's a mosquito, which transmits very serious diseases. Dangerous.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central 
  Idea III <i>– I get confused: it's a disease transmitted by an insect, very 
  dangerous, and that can give you yellow fever</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Collective 
  subject discourse III: <i>It's a disease transmitted by a little mosquito, and 
  it can kill you; there is one that kills, and I don't know the other one, there 
  are two types. It's not dengue, it's yellow fever. ...I mix it all up, I think 
  that it's an insect that transmits a very dangerous disease, yellow fever, the 
  mosquito disease,</i> Aedes aegypti<i>, and that it likes clean, still water, 
  that's how it spreads, I don't know the word, then it bites you, gives you yellow 
  fever. It's a kind of yellow fever that comes from vases with still water.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central 
  Idea IV <i>– Dengue is a disease that gives you headache, fever, vomiting, diarrhea. 
  It's transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, that you can find in clean, 
  still water. That's why we have to get rid of breeding places</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Collective 
  subject discourse IV: <i>That's the little I know about dengue, that it's a 
  disease transmitted by a mosquito, when you leave water in a vase. It's a contagious 
  disease, transmitted by a vector that proliferates more in clean, still water 
  and in running water, or in those vases, the xaxim plate; it can stay for almost 
  a year, alive, around the plate, where there's no water. Then it can fall into 
  that water and proliferate and transmit the disease. It's a horrible disease, 
  that gives you body pain, fever, dizziness, makes you feel bad, and vomit, and 
  causes spots on your skin. That's why you have to take care of everything, keep 
  the backyard clean, you can't leave water in drums, open water tanks, and tires, 
  or else the mosquito will come out from that water, then it can go and bite 
  a child, an adult, or an older person, and it makes the children sick. There's 
  also hemorrhagic dengue, that can be fatal, I don't know if getting care in 
  time will help, but I don't think so. The ladies came here, looked at the flower 
  vases, and then, since it had rained, and water got into the vase, then they 
  found a little mosquito there. Then the guys from surveillance came and told 
  us it was really a dengue breeding site. But, on the same day as the lady came, 
  I threw it out right in front of her, with the flowers and all, and all the 
  vases I have now don't have the little plate with water underneath them, and 
  if they do, you have to put sand in it. They always come by with an explanatory 
  flier, they ask if they can come in, and we let them in.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central 
  Idea V <i>– Dengue is a disease transmitted by a contaminated mosquito that 
  bites people and contaminates them. Pots that gather water can breed the mosquito. 
  That's why you mustn't leave still water around</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Collective 
  subject discourse V: <i>Oh, as far as I know, it's a mosquito called</i> Aedes 
  aegypcius <i>or</i> aegypti, <i>I'm not sure, and that if it bites you and if 
  it's contaminated, then it can transmit the disease; I mean, if it breeds in 
  the water, like in those little pots, tires, and bottles that gather water, 
  the mosquito that transmits dengue can come and cause dengue. That's why we 
  have to be careful, put thick sand, not leave that still water there. If someone's 
  bitten by the mosquito, he'll be contaminated, have a lot of fever, body pains, 
  headache, and it can even lead to death. So that's it: what I know is that dengue 
  is a contaminated mosquito that bites someone and that person gets contaminated. 
  It's a virus, transmitted by a mosquito that causes this problem, that brings 
  serious problems to your health, and that it proliferates in water inside abandoned 
  things; that's more or less what I don't want in my backyard.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Question 
  2 – "<i>In the educational campaigns, they say that you shouldn't leave water 
  in plant vases. Do you know why?</i>"</b></font></p>

  idea II <i>– Because the dengue mosquitoes deposit their larvae in water</i></b></font></p>

  subject discourse II: <i>Because the mosquito comes and puts his little larvae 
  there and starts reproducing. The dengue bug is a mosquito and it lays larvae 
  in the water and that's where the mosquito that transmits dengue comes from. 
  The plant vase is a mosquito breeding place, water gathers in there and the 
  mosquitoes proliferate; they lay their larvae, and then mosquito breeding proliferates.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central

  water and to put medicine in it all the time</i></b></font></p>

  subject discourse III: <i>It's in clean water, as the say, I think that in dirty 
  water the dengue mosquitoes can't breed. That's where a lot of dengue sites 
  appear, that's because the folks slack off, so then, if you have it, you have 
  to change it (the water) all the time, and put medicine in it, so that it doesn't 
  harm our own health and so that the mosquito can't breed in that water, or else 
  the mosquito will breed.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Central 
  idea IV <i>– Because it's in still water that the mosquitoes lay their eggs, 
  that's where they grow, proliferate, increase, and give origin to the dengue 
  mosquito</i></b></font></p>

  subject discourse IV: <i>It's in still water that they breed, those little dengue 
  bugs, the mosquito. Because it goes there to lay eggs in the water, and it procreates, 
  so we can't leave still water around, so that the dengue larvae don't breed. 
  This mosquito, it multiplies in water, it's in water that they transform themselves. 
  They come, lay their eggs, and then they progress, right, procreate. In clean 
  water, the mosquitoes love it, it's eggs are latent, until it rains, or until 
  it gives rise to new mosquitoes. The mosquito stops there, and then leaves its 
  egg, it can come out of there&#133; the larvae are born, and then the dengue 
  mosquito can come out of there.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The</i> 
  Aedes <i>stays there, still, alive, close to the edges, then, the day when it 
  happens that the water covers the plate and spills over, then it can breed in 
  the clean water, proliferate, and contaminate, and then it'll transmit the disease, 
  and it will be really bad for a lot of people, with this lack of care. The mosquito 
  larvae grow in plant vases. That's where the mosquito lays its eggs, especially 
  in vases, because it's always in the vases that there's water the way they like 
  it, it's its main environment for reproduction, in that still water, because 
  the water that gathers in the vases breeds the mosquito. We can see it when 
  we empty the cans.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">I learned 
  that I can never leave still water lying around, and I taught my kids too, especially 
  the girl, she waters the plants and says: "look, mom, you can't leave water 
  there", right, that, I've learnt well. So you can't leave still water around, 
  you have always to put some earth in it, if you leave still water, then they 
  come, and lay their eggs, right?</font></p>

  a matter of culture, I think it's just like St. Thomas, "you have to see it

  it. I think it's because nothing has happened yet, and they haven't seen anyone, 
  like, sick with dengue, so I believe that they are helpless; people are very

  check whether there's dengue or not: what good are all those campaigns that 
  doctors and the government make if I don't clean my backyard, and my neighbor

  when all this will end, or else, the government is doing all it can. I think

  the government is there to warn us. Only that we have to be conscious and try 
  to help ourselves, right, not leaving things around that'll let the mosquito 
  bite us. The entire population has to do with this, because everyone has to 
  be careful, right? The doctors aren't going to come to your house and clean

  works together that we can completely combat dengue, because all the people 
  aren't together in this, there's no way we can combat it, if one person wants 
  to combat it but the other one doesn't, then it's useless. Having campaigns, 
  having this, or that, everyone has to have a purpose; not only the government 
  is to blame. I think that it's right that the government has to help, putting 
  insecticide in all the vacant lots; they even have to force some industries 
  to clean up, take away their trash, the factories, but I think that if the people 
  aren't united it's impossible, not even if they come every single day. I think

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Two conditions 
  are necessary (albeit perhaps not sufficient) for preventive behavior to take 
  place and maintain itself when dealing with such a complex disease as dengue: 
  that messages be formulated by the competent authorities and decoded by in individuals 
  in the population as correctly as possible, and that the messages decoded by 
  these individuals make full sense to them.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Messages 
  appropriately formulated by sanitary authorities will obviously have a greater 
  probability of being adequately decoded by the individuals; messages adequately 
  decoded by the individuals have greater chance of making sense to them; and 
  correct messages that are correctly understood and meaningful to these individuals 
  will have a much greater chance of being transformed into preventive behaviors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Based on 
  these assumptions, the present research allows us to raise a few interpretive 
  hypotheses concerning the Social Representations found:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Exceedingly 
  synthetic educational messages emitted by sanitary authorities</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A number 
  of collective subject discourses clearly show that a very schematic idea has 
  entered people's imaginary universe, one which centralizes the dengue issue 
  on – and almost entirely reduces it to – combating the <i>dengue mosquito</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The unquestionable 
  need to eliminate the vector, presented perhaps in a somewhat exaggerated fashion 
  in the educational messages, has produced, among other things, an undesirable 
  effect: it has led the population to confuse dengue and its vector, or, when 
  defining dengue, to mistake a part for the whole.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Such confusion 
  does not favor the adoption of preventive behaviors, since it renders the relationship 
  between 'water' and 'mosquito' obscure or even incomprehensible, and, consequently, 
  all the 'larval' logistics of fighting the disease as well. Furthermore, it 
  favors, among the population, an equivocal understanding of the disease, in 
  that it reduces it to an erroneous and partial cause-effect relationship ("the 
  person becomes sick because of the bite of the dengue mosquito").</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Presence 
  of erroneous information in the imaginary universe</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Some discourses 
  point towards the presence of erroneous information among the population, including 
  a confusion of dengue and yellow fever, which, of course, is partly due to the 
  common vector. Likewise, one notices the presence of other erroneous ideas, 
  such as that the mosquito deposits its larvae directly into the water, a mistake 
  which may be due to the larvae, unlike the eggs, being visible to the naked 
  eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Understanding 
  of the basic mechanism of disease transmission</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">On the other 
  hand, other CSDs show that ideas that are basically correct, concerning breeding 
  sites and modes of transmission, are also included in the people's imaginary 
  universe, showing that the population is capable of understanding a relatively 
  complex disease, such as dengue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Awareness 
  of the population's role in combating the disease</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, 
  our data reveals the population's ability to discriminate between their own 
  responsibilities and those of other parties (government and healthcare professionals) 
  in controlling the disease through the eradication of the vector.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mistrust 
  in educational activities in general</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Other discourses 
  point towards an important challenge to be faced: a certain amount of saturation 
  concerning educational campaigns in general, and those related to health especially, 
  which is undoubtedly part of a much wider-ranging phenomenon, rooted on a contemporary 
  society and culture overloaded with all kinds of information, which greatly 
  hamper the population's receptivity and willingness towards educational messages, 
  thereby undermining the efficiency and efficacy of educational activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"They'll 
  only believe in the disease when it happens to them"</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The war 
  against dengue and the strategy adopted for vector eradication require educational 
  activities calling for an eminently preventive behavior, the achievement of 
  which is a formidable task for a population exceedingly accustomed – concerning 
  disease-related events – to a reactive behavior, in which measures are only 
  taken after the fact is installed. Indeed, the presence of ideas such as: "people 
  will only believe in the disease when it happens to them" indicates that part 
  of the population still does not feel sufficiently at risk of contracting the 
  disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Disbelief 
  that a 'tiny little mosquito' can cause such extensive problems</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Here again 
  we can notice the presence in the social imaginary universe of ideas that reveal 
  certain difficulties in correctly situating the mosquito within the complex 
  process that is dengue, which indicates that educational information is still 
  insufficient for a thorough understanding of the disease by the population as 
  a whole, a condition necessary for the installation and maintenance of preventive 
  behaviors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Appreciation 
  of the role and constant presence of sanitary authorities</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The discourses 
  reveal that the population greatly appreciates the constant presence, in dengue-afflicted 
  areas, of sanitary authorities, visiting homes, controlling the presence of 
  the vector, and helping the population in its domestic control of <i>A. aegypti</i> 
  This indicates a very important achievement in terms of educational results 
  in dealing with diseases such as dengue, which is the imperativeness of promoting 
  a constant educational activity, 'one-on-one' with the population.</font></p>
