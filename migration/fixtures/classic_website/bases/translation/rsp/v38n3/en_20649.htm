<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Acute respiratory diseases - ARD, mainly pneumonias, are the most important 
  cause of death among children under five years of age and are responsible for 
  severe diseases among people over sixty years of age. This study aims to describe 
  the main epidemiological characteristics of ARD cases notified by healthcare 
  centers.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>ARD patients' records from medical consultations at 100 public health care 
  centers and hospitals were reviewed every week in the period from 1996 to 2001 
  and data was filled out on a specific form. Data was classified as pneumonia 
  and not pneumonia according to age groups.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>During this period, 2,050,845 ARD cases were informed. May and June were 
  the months with the largest number of cases. ARDs were more frequent among children 
  aged one to four years old. The latter concentrated about twice the number of 
  cases of other age groups. Pneumonias represented approximately 7.7% of the 
  ARD cases.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>The magnitude of ARD numbers may be observed and it should stimulate appropriate 
  diagnosis, early treatment, and prevention, both in regard to the event itself 
  and complications ensuing from it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Acute respiratory 
  diseases (ARD) include a wide range of morbid events of different etiologies 
  and distinct gravity which expose the respiratory tract to further risks. The 
  main clinical manifestations of ARDs are coughing, difficulty breathing, sore 
  throat, nasal discharge, and ear aches.<sup>8</sup> ARDs may be infectious diseases 
  (common colds and pneumonias, for example) or non-infectious (such as allergic 
  rhinitis and asthma), sometimes it is not possible to distinguish their origin.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">About 40% 
  of the children who seek medical care have an acute respiratory infection (ARI). 
  ARI, particularly pneumonia, is the main cause of death in children under five 
  years of age, being responsible for two million infant deaths annually. It corresponds 
  to 25% to 33% of the total number of deaths observed in the first five years 
  of life.<sup>6,11</sup> Frequently, these deaths are attributed to other causes, 
  when, in fact, they are the consequence of "occult" ARI.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Both in 
  developed and in developing countries, respiratory diseases represent a great 
  proportion of infant morbidity and, therefore, exert great pressure on health 
  care services.<sup>10,11</sup> ARDs are responsible for approximately one fifth 
  of the hospital admissions in the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de (SUS)</i><sup>5</sup> 
  &#91;Brazilian Public Health System&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">ARD also 
  provoke severe diseases, frequent admissions and death among adults older than 
  60 years of age.<sup>4</sup> Adults presented from one to three episodes of 
  ARD,<sup>1</sup> per year which provokes much work abstention and individual, 
  enterprise and state national financial loss.<sup>9</sup> Unfortunately, particularly 
  among children, ARDs are considered "normal", by the population as well as by 
  the majority of health professionals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
  ARD does not figure among the diseases of national compulsory notification. 
  Thus, more precise data concerning the epidemiological trends of ARDs are scarce.<sup>3</sup> 
  Since 1995, ARDs have been monitored by the municipal center of epidemiological 
  surveillance in Fortaleza, Cear&aacute;, &#91;situated in the Brazilian Northeast&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of this study is to describe the main epidemiological characteristics of of 
  acute respiratory disease cases informed by public health centers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The definition 
  of ARD utilized for the purpose of data collection was "every inflammatory process, 
  whether or not it is infectious, which affects the respiratory tract.<sup>4</sup> 
  Therefore, it may occur in the nose, ears, pharynges, trachea, bronchi and lungs.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Classification 
  in pneumonia and non pneumonia was made according to the diagnosis registered 
  in the report made by the physician who attended the case. In general, diagnosis 
  of pneumonia in the outpatients health centers, was based on the patient history 
  and physical examination, looking for the presence of unusually rapid breathing 
  and retraction of rib muscles at each breath.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, 
  the notification of ARD was implemented. The number of notifying public health 
  centers stabilized in 1996, having encompassed all public health care centers 
  and those which had celebrated covenants with <i>SUS</i>, including both emergency 
  hospitals and outpatient services in Fortaleza. These health centers provided 
  information for this study. According to estimates, 70% of Fortaleza's population 
  is attended by <i>SUS</i>. Private clinics rarely inform health surveillance 
  officials of any of the diseases included among those of national compulsory 
  notification or of ARDs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">ARDs were 
  consolidated weekly in a specific form filled out at the healthcare centers, 
  based on the medical records registered by the attending physician, and distributed 
  according to classification in non pneumonia or pneumonia and by age group (infants 
  aged less than one year old, from one to four, from five to nine and older than 
  10 years old). The consolidated reports followed the same flux as the diseases 
  of compulsory notification: each health center sent its records to the <i>Secretaria 
  Executiva Regional (SER)</i> &#91;Regional Executive Secretary&#93; in which the health 
  center was located, and each <i>SER</i> consolidated the data from its centers 
  and sent it to the <i>C&eacute;lula de Vigil&acirc;ncia Epidemiol&oacute;gica 
  da Secretaria Municipal de Sa&uacute;de</i> <i>de Fortaleza</i> <i>(CEVEPI)</i> 
  &#91;Epidemiological Surveillance Cell of Department of Health of Fortaleza Municipality&#93;, 
  where the data from the six <i>SERs</i> were reunited.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At the <i>CEVEPI</i>, 
  data was organized and stored in a databank utilizing the Excel program. There 
  is a file for data from each <i>SER</i>, organized according to each epidemiological 
  week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Descriptive 
  analysis of the cases of ARD attended in out-patient services between 1996 e 
  2001 was undertaken.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Information 
  concerning pluviometrics was obtained from the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Cearense 
  de Metereologia (Funceme)</i> &#91;Ceara State Foundation of Meteorology&#93;.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From 1996 
  to 2001, 2,050,845 cases of ARD were informed. In general, the months of May 
  and June had the largest number of notifications, having presented an average 
  of 36,978.7 cases in May and 37,679.2 cases in June. The months of the year 
  which presented the smallest number of cases of ARD were January and February. 
  From March until June, the number of cases tended to increase and, from then 
  on, the tendency was to decrease (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From 1996 
  to 1999, the number of cases of ARD tended to increase, the latter being the 
  year with the largest number of notifications. A tendency towards stabilization 
  was noted between 2000 and 2001. The general incidence of ARD demonstrated a 
  small variation between 1997 and 2001, except for the year 1999, when a peak 
  was observed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is not 
  always possible to identify a correlation between pluviometric indexes and the 
  number of cases of ARD: the increase in the number of cases just after the rain 
  may be observed as well as the lack of any kind of correspondence with the rain 
  (<a href="#fig1">Figure</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A similar 
  distribution may be a observed for both diseases of the superior respiratory 
  tract and pneumonias, isolatedly and for ARDs among infants under one year of 
  age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From 1996 
  to 2001 the pneumonias represented, on the average, 7.7% of the cases of ARD 
  notified, varying from 6.1%, in 1997, to 8.7%, in 1996 and in 2000 (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Approximately 
  38.8% of the cases of ARD (797,677 cases) occurred among children aged one to 
  four years old. The other age groups, including the one with children aged ten 
  or older, are represented by roughly 20% of the cases. The greatest risk group 
  was the one composed by infants under one year of age; the incidence among them 
  was 1,115.7 cases for each thousand infants younger than one year of age. Among 
  children aged one to four, the incidence of ARD cases was 516.2/1,000, among 
  children ranging in age from five to nine years old it was 209.3/1,000 and among 
  those over ten it was 35.4/1,000 (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
  little variation in the incidence of ARD during the study period, except for 
  the elevation in the number of cases in 1999, suggestive of a an epidemic in 
  Fortaleza. The annual median of notifications during these six years was 341,808 
  cases, with a monthly average of 20,484 cases. If the distribution of cases 
  were uniform among the 100 notifying centers, the average would be 205 cases 
  per month. Thus, a physician would be necessary to attend theses cases, being 
  that 70% of the cases attended by him would be ARDs. However, during the periods 
  of higher incidence, the average number of cases would double, and the number 
  of professionals attending these cases would have to be reformulated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was verified 
  that the number of cases per month, on the average, begins to increase in March 
  and to decrease from July onwards. This suggests that the behavior of the ARDs 
  in the municipality of Forltaleza is different than that observed in the Southeast 
  region of the country.<sup>2,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The age 
  groups utilized in this study represented a limitation for a more detailed analysis 
  of ARD among the elderly. These age groups were defined for acute diarrheas 
  and ARD during the cholera epidemic in the Northeast, when the greatest concern 
  was early detection of cholera and monitoring ARD during infancy. By now, the 
  most important age groups for this monitoring, could be re-evaluate taking into 
  consideration the gravity which respiratory diseases may assume among older 
  adults.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data collected 
  does not allow us to assess gravity and evolution of the patients, since these 
  cases were not submitted to in-depth investigation and the great majority only 
  received ambulatory care. The residential addresses of the patients is not registered 
  and because of the mobility of the patients, who can seek care in any public 
  health care center independent from the distance of their homes, cases distribution 
  according to the location in which they were attended may not coincide withy 
  their place of residence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">ARDs monitoring 
  strategy need to be refined. It is possible that upon adequately filling out 
  the information on diagnosis, within the <i>Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  de Atendimentos Ambulatoriais (SAI-SUS)</i> &#91;Ambulatory Care Information System&#93;, 
  a more precise epidemiological picture will be revealed, without increasing 
  the costs of ARDs and other diseases. While this goal has not yet been attained, 
  it is necessary to improve the quality of information and analysis in order 
  to improve planning of health interventions. This, in turn, will make it possible 
  to take better care of these illnesses and to undertake prevention of the more 
  serious diseases and their complications, as well as validation studies which 
  make improvements possible.</font></p>
