<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b>To 
  evaluate the impact of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative on breastfeeding 
  practices among newborns admitted to a neonatal unit, during hospitalization 
  and during the first six months of life.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The medical records of all newborns admitted to the neonatal 
  unit of a teaching hospital in 1994 (N=285) and 1998 (N=368) were reviewed, 
  and information on the infants' feeding practices during hospitalization and 
  during the first six months of life was analyzed. The duration of breastfeeding 
  and exclusive breastfeeding and the differences between the two years were assessed 
  using the Kaplan-Meier technique and the Log-Rank test. Logistic regression 
  and Cox analysis were performed for confounder control.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>There was an important increase in the percentage of infants 
  given breast milk exclusively (1.9% in 1994 to 41.7% in 1998) during hospitalization, 
  and feeding with formula alone, observed in 17.7% of infants in 1994, was no 
  longer noted in 1998. With respect to breastfeeding practices during the first 
  six months of life, the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding increased 
  from 12 days in 1994 to 45 days in 1998. As to breastfeeding, which includes 
  the ingestion of other types of food, no significant difference was observed.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The implementation of the initiative in the studied hospital 
  contributed towards an increase in the exclusive breastfeeding of newborn babies 
  during neonatal unit admission and during the first six months of life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In light 
  of the numerous benefits of human milk, breastfeeding is the best means of feeding 
  the infant child. Mothers must be oriented to breastfeed their children exclusively 
  – that is, without other complementary foods – until the sixth month of life. 
  After this age, complementation with other foods rich in iron, vitamins, and 
  other nutrients becomes necessary, but breastfeeding should be maintained, preferably 
  until the age of 24 months, or even later.<sup>7,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The appropriateness 
  and the benefits of breast milk extend also to preterm infants with low birth 
  weight as well as to infants requiring admission to neonatal care units. However, 
  experience has shown that the mothers of such children face substantial difficulties 
  when attempting at achieving sustained breastfeeding, for a large share of these 
  infants remain hospitalized in neonatal care units for extended periods, and 
  suffer from suction deficiencies due to the immaturity of this reflex at birth. 
  The initial separation also hinders mother-child bonding, an essential factor 
  in successful breastfeeding (BF).<sup>9,13</sup> Additionally, the physical 
  arrangement of maternities, their routines, and healthcare professionals' insufficient 
  knowledge of breastfeeding have a negative influence on the success of breastfeeding 
  initiation, favoring termination while still in the hospital.<sup>10,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  context, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was introduced as a means 
  of mobilizing healthcare professionals in favor of breastfeeding. BFHI is a 
  global strategy sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef, 
  aimed at promoting, protecting, and supporting breastfeeding through the establishment, 
  in hospitals, of pro-breastfeeding measures known as the 'Ten Steps to Successful 
  Breastfeeding'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the city 
  of Londrina, in southern Brazil, the BFHI was implemented in three hospitals. 
  This initiative is believed to have greatly contributed towards the changing 
  of hospital practices and routines related to breastfeeding. However, as in 
  many other places, there were no studies evaluating the contribution of this 
  initiative to children requiring intensive care, who were admitted to intensive 
  care/treatment units (neonatal ICU/ITUs). Thus, the goal of the present study 
  was to compare the frequency of both BF and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) during 
  admission to neonatal ICU/ITUs and during the first six months of life, before 
  and after the implementation of the BFHI.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  was carried out in a neonatal unit of a teaching hospital in Londrina, Paran&aacute; 
  State, southern Brazil, where the BFHI had been implemented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Study population 
  included all newborns admitted to the neonatal ICU/ITU in 1994 (N=285), the 
  year preceding BFHI implementation in that hospital, and 1998 (N=368), when 
  the hospital considered the "ten steps" process as completed. Newborns who died 
  up to 48 hours after delivery (17 cases in 1994 and 18 cases in 1998) were excluded 
  from the sample due to their extremely severe clinical conditions, which required 
  parenteral feeding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data was 
  collected from the medical records of ICU/ITU-admitted newborns. Information 
  collected included the child's feeding patterns during admission and first six 
  months of life, in addition to other variables of interest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Information 
  on the child's feeding during the first semester was obtained mainly through 
  the follow-up provided by the hospital itself, in a specific outpatient facility 
  for preterm babies, which keeps records of patients' visits in their medical 
  files. The percentage of losses of feeding information during the first six 
  months was similar in both groups, and corresponded to 33.4% of the children 
  admitted in 1994 and 34.8% of the children admitted in 1998. Statistical analysis 
  revealed no significant differences in the characteristics of the children for 
  whom this information was missing between 1994 and 1998. The absence of such 
  information was due mainly to failure to return for a follow-up appointment 
  or to missing entries, in the child's medical files, with the type of feeding 
  the child was receiving at the time of the appointment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data analysis 
  was carried out through frequency comparison, using the Kaplan-Meier survival 
  table and the Log-Rank test for estimating, respectively, the duration of breastfeeding 
  and the differences between 1994 and 1998, in terms of both EBF and BF. EBF 
  was defined as exclusive feeding with milk from the child's own mother or from 
  a human milk bank (HMB). BF was defined as feeding with milk from the child's 
  own mother or from a HMB, complemented with other foods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Cox and 
  logistic regression models were employed in order to control for the effects 
  of variables which differed significantly between 1994 and 1998 and that might 
  have had any potential influence on changes observed in these children's dietary 
  patterns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This project 
  was analyzed and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the Public Health 
  School of the <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> and of the <i>Universidade 
  Estadual de Londrina</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> shows the characteristics of newborns admitted to the neonatal ICU/ITU 
  in 1994 and 1998. There was an increase in the frequency of newborns whose mothers 
  did not live in Londrina (from 22.8% on 1994 to 36.0% in 1998), a diminution 
  in the frequency of low-birthweight (from 69.7% to 59.2%) and of small-for-gestational-age 
  babies (from 23.1% to 14.0%), and an improvement in Apgar index distribution. 
  Distributions in terms of sex, gestational age, and duration of hospitalization 
  were unaltered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> describes the type of food given to newborns during hospitalization, where 
  significant changes in the newborns' feeding patterns can be observed (p&lt;0.0001). 
  There was an expressive increase in the percentage of children who were exclusively 
  breastfed (from 1.9% in 1994 to 41.7% in 1998). It was also noted that, despite 
  the existence of an HMB in the hospital already in 1994, milk from this source 
  was not used at this time. By 1998, the HMB was playing an active role in the 
  maintenance of the exclusive breastfeeding of children admitted to the neonatal 
  ICU/ITU, and the practice of exclusive formula feeding had been abolished.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As to the 
  use of combined types of milk, in 1994, 80% of the children were given an association 
  of maternal breast milk and formula; in 1998 such association virtually disappeared 
  (0.6%), having been replaced mostly by a combination of maternal breast milk, 
  milk from the HMB, and formula.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the logistic 
  regression analysis, feeding patterns during hospitalization were characterized 
  as EBF or non-EBF, since there were no children fed exclusively with formula 
  in 1998. In the final model, confounder control only slightly diminished the 
  strong association between year of admission and EBF, with a crude odds ratio 
  (OR) of 36.1 (95% CI 13.9-101.8) before, and an OR of 35.7 (95% CI 14.2-89.9) 
  after confounder control.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The frequency 
  of BF during the first six months of life for the 1994 and 1998 children was 
  estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique, distinguishing between two categories: 
  BF and EBF. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> presents BF survival curves for the 
  first six months. Median BF duration was 176 days in 1994 and 180 days in 1998. 
  The Log-Rank test indicated no significant differences between the 1994 and 
  1998 survival curves.</font></p>

  2</a> presents EBF survival curves for the first six months. Median EBF duration 
  was 12 days in 1994 and 45 days in 1998. The Log-Rank test indicated a significant 
  difference (p&lt;0.001) between the 1994 and 1998 EBF survival curves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The children 
  from 1994 and 1998 that were accompanied during the first six months of life 
  differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) with respect to two variables: weight/gestational 
  age ratio and duration of hospitalization. In order to control for the influence 
  of these differences on BF and EBF in the first six months, the Cox regression 
  model was employed, the results of which confirmed the absence of statistically 
  significant differences in the frequency of BF in the first six months in 1994 
  and 1998 (adjusted OR=1.07; 95% CI 0.82-1.40). The greater frequency of EBF 
  in 1998 remained significantly higher in the final regression model even after 
  confounder control (adjusted OR=3.77; 95% CI 1.15-12.35), which indicates that 
  the odds of babies born in 1998 having been breastfed exclusively during the 
  first six months of live are almost fourfold those of babies born in 1994.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Evaluations 
  of the effectiveness of interventions already implemented by health services 
  are frequent in Brazil.<sup>8</sup> If, on one hand, this is desirable, since 
  there is a need for incorporating evaluation into the practice of healthcare 
  services, on the other, it may generate methodological limitations for research. 
  The present study was conducted after the implementation of the BFHI program, 
  and included an analysis of records already present in the healthcare facility. 
  From this perspective, the study's main limitation was the impossibility of 
  establishing a comparable control group. The simultaneous observation, in a 
  prospective study, of an intervention group and of a randomly selected control 
  group – the design considered as most appropriate for evaluating this type of 
  alteration – was unfeasible due not only to the survey having been conducted 
  after the implementation of the BFHI in the hospital, but also to ethical issues, 
  since there would have been one group which would benefit from breastfeeding 
  and another which would not. The control group in the present study corresponded 
  to the entire population of newborns admitted to the ICU/ITU in 1994, before 
  the implementation of the BFHI. In order to compensate for the limitation posed 
  by the lack of a randomly selected control group, we sought to identify eventual 
  differences between the 1994 and 1998 groups and to control for these differences 
  when comparing feeding patterns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">On the other 
  hand, there are a few studies done in controlled populations that demonstrate 
  the effectiveness of the BFHI on EBF. Luther et al<sup>5</sup> compared two 
  groups of women from Santos, southeastern Brazil, one of which gave birth in 
  a 'Baby-Friendly' hospital and another in a hospital without the program (control 
  group). The results showed a 53-day increase in EBF duration among women who 
  gave birth at the 'Baby-Friendly' hospital. Correa<sup>2</sup> analyzed the 
  impact of healthcare measures on the duration of total breastfeeding in children 
  born in two different hospitals, also in Santos, one of which had implemented 
  the BFHI. The results showed that the implementation of the 'ten steps' contributed 
  to the fulfillment of the need for protection, promotion, and motivation of 
  breastfeeding in maternities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Levin,<sup>4</sup> the BFHI would tend to benefit only healthy infants, since 
  the 'ten steps' would have an effect only on maternity routine procedures, whereas 
  a neonatal intensive therapy unit in the same hospital would not respond to 
  all steps. However, the results of the present study are contrary to this author's 
  opinion, since the implementation of BFHI's 'ten steps' in the neonatal ICU/ITU 
  of the hospital studied resulted in increased rates of EBF (increasing median 
  duration from 12 to 45 days between 1994 and 1998) and in the abolishment of 
  the use of exclusive formula. Although it is not a strategy specifically designed 
  for neonatal ICUs, in the hospital studied, the BFHI contributed towards the 
  modification of feeding practices among children demanding special care, and 
  towards an elongation of the duration of EBF in the first six months. This may 
  be due to an increase in the healthcare team's motivation to change practices 
  related to child feeding, and to the presence of a HMB in the same hospital. 
  A similar survey conducted at the Boston Medical Center in the US, published 
  in 2003, also demonstrated a positive impact of the BFHI on EBF and BF among 
  children admitted to neonatal ICU/ITUs. <sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is now 
  known that preterm babies are capable of responding appropriately when fed with 
  human milk, and that the milk produced by the baby's own mother has a unique 
  composition in terms of protein-energy contribution and immunological constituents. 
  This milk is adjusted to the physiological peculiarities of the baby's metabolism, 
  a fact which led the neonatal intensive care units of 'Baby-Friendly' hospitals 
  to use exclusively human milk, with excellent results.<sup>1</sup> In this context, 
  although not mandatory, it is recommended that institutions with neonatal ICUs 
  also have access to a milk bank, preferably in the same premises, in order to 
  provide for high-risk newborns admitted to the ICU. As has been demonstrated, 
  the milk bank in the hospital studied played an essential part in the EBF of 
  children admitted to the neonatal ICU/ITU.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Increases 
  in median EBF duration become quite significant when dealing with preterm and 
  low-birthweight newborns. A study conducted by Hylander et al,<sup>3</sup> in 
  the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the University of Georgia's Medical Center, 
  demonstrated a positive effect of breast milk on the incidence of infections 
  among very-low-birthweight children during hospitalization. The incidence of 
  infections was 29.3% among children who were given breast milk and 47.2% among 
  those who received formula, and the incidence of sepsis and meningitis was 19.5% 
  and 32.6% in these two groups, respectively. Infections were thus significantly 
  reduced among children fed with breast milk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The milk 
  produced by the mothers of preterm babies is beneficial not only due to the 
  higher levels of immunological factors, but also because of the lower risk of 
  contamination. Preterm and low-birthweight babies do not always benefit from 
  immunoglobulin transfer of through the placenta, which takes place after the 
  34<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. Due to the pathogenic environment to which 
  they are exposed during admission to neonatal intensive care units, it is essential 
  that newborns receive protection factors through breast milk, be it from their 
  own mothers or, if this is not available, from a human milk bank, provided it 
  is compatible with the baby's gestational age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The decision 
  of going through with all the steps of the BFHI, the change in the team's posture 
  with respect to the feeding of these children, and the presence of a HMB in 
  the hospital contributed towards the improvement of BF rates in a group of children 
  for which breastfeeding was especially difficult, in light of the problems faced 
  by infant, mother, family, and by the healthcare team that cares for the baby 
  during delivery and hospitalization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing 
  the rate of BF during ICU admission and outpatient follow up periods is also 
  a means of ensuring the long-term benefits brought by this breastfeeding in 
  terms of the immunological, emotional, nutritional, and neurological development 
  of these children.</font></p>
