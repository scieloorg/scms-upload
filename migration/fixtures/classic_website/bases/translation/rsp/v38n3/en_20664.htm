<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>The occurrence of orofacial pain and chronic pain are frequent subjects 
  for study today, but few studies have been made on dental pain in Brazil. The 
  objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of dental pain and the associated 
  factors as the reason for visiting a dentist among adults.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>A cross-sectional study was carried out among 860 workers aged 
  18-58 years at a cooperative located in the State of Santa Catarina, in 1999. 
  The clinical examinations and interviews were carried out by dentists who had 
  received prior guidance. Complaints of dental pain as the reason for the last 
  visit to a dentist were analyzed as the dependent variable, in relation to the 
  socioeconomic and demographic conditions, access to dental services, shift pattern 
  and caries (via the DMFT index), as the independent variables. Non-conditional 
  multiple logistic regression analysis was utilized.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>The prevalence of dental pain as the reason for the last visit 
  to a dentist was 18.7% (CI 95%: 15.9-20.1) and the mean DMFT index (decayed, 
  missing and filled teeth) was 20.2 (CI 95%: 19.7-20.7), with 54% represented 
  by the 'missing' component. The following were independently associated with 
  the presence of dental pain: schooling of less than or equal to eight years 
  (OR=1.9; CI 95%: 1.1-3.1); four to fifteen teeth lost due to caries (OR=2.6; 
  CI 95%: 1.4-4.9); 16 to 32 teeth lost due to caries (OR=2.5; CI 95%: 1.1-5.8); 
  and not having visited the company's dental service (OR=2.8; CI 95%: 1.6-5.1).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>Dental pain reflects the severity of the dental caries, 
  expressed by the 'missing' component of the DMFT and non-usage of the company's 
  dental services. These factors are determined by social conditions and represented 
  by the schooling level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated 
  that 30 million Brazilians have never visited a dentist<sup>4</sup>, even though 
  the country has one of the biggest numbers of dentists in the world, both in 
  absolute terms and in relation to the size of the population, as established 
  by the World Health Organization.<sup>15</sup> The dental attendance and assistance 
  provided by the public sector in Brazil almost exclusively prioritizes school 
  children between the ages of 6 and 12 years, except for a few isolated municipalities 
  in which the healthcare attention has also been directed towards other age groups 
  within the population. Targeted actions, which in the majority of cases have 
  been centered on the reparative and extractive attendance offered to the adult 
  population throughout the history of public policies in Brazil, did not undergo 
  significant alteration after the implementation of the Single Healthcare System 
  in 1990. Among other attributes, this established the principles of universality, 
  completeness and equality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With the 
  decline in dental caries among school-age children, seen in the latest epidemiological 
  surveys performed in 1986<sup>7</sup> and 1996<sup>12</sup> and, especially, 
  with the inclusion of the oral healthcare team in the Family Healthcare Program 
  by the Ministry of Health in 2000, it has become indispensable for other groups 
  within the population to be considered. Because of the systematic exclusion 
  of the adult population from dental services, this population has been directed 
  towards the emergency dental services, in most cases because of pain. Within 
  the field of medicine, pain is responsible for one-third of consultations made 
  in Brazil.<sup>13</sup> Pain is defined by the International Association for 
  the Study of Pain (IASP) as "a disagreeable sensory and emotional experience" 
  of subjective nature that is associated with real or potential injuries, in 
  which "each individual utilizes the word according to the individual's learning 
  from previous experience". Pain has historically been considered to be only 
  a symptom, from which the characteristics will guide the diagnosis of morbidities, 
  in the teachings of the health sector.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Within the 
  field of dentistry, recent studies have pointed towards the pressing need for 
  greater attention in this respect. According to Ekanayake &amp; Mendis<sup>1</sup> 
  (2002), dental pain is a significant predictor of the utilization of dental 
  services. A study on oral health among adults with teeth in the United Kingdom 
  indicated that pain was the most frequent problem over the preceding 12-month 
  period (40%), thus interfering directly with these individuals' daily activities.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, 
  studies on orofacial pain have mostly related to temporal-mandibular dysfunctions. 
  No Brazilian publications regarding epidemiological data on dental pain were 
  found in the Medline, Lilacs and BBO databases for the period from 1994 to 2002, 
  when the terms <i>'dental pain'</i> and <i>'toothache'</i> were utilized<i>.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study had the objectives of determining the prevalence of dental pain as the 
  main reason for the last visit to a dentist among a group of workers in the 
  State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, and verifying the existence of an association 
  with socioeconomic conditions, working conditions and access to dental services.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional 
  study was performed among all the workers of the West-Central Cooperative of 
  the State of Santa Catarina, at its unit in the municipality of Maravilha, Santa 
  Catarina, Brazil, in 1999 (N=860). Maravilha is located in the western region 
  of the state, and is a predominantly urban municipality with less than 30% of 
  its population residing in the rural zone. The biggest local economic activity 
  is in the cold-storage sector. The research sample was made up of workers aged 
  between 18 and 58 years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A structured 
  questionnaire was applied to determine the prevalence of dental pain as the 
  reason for the last visit to a dentist. The questionnaire also investigated 
  demographic characteristics, socioeconomic attributes, working conditions (shift 
  pattern) and information on access to and type of dental services utilized. 
  The workers were also examined by one of the authors of the present study (EMS), 
  in order to obtain information on the prevalence and severity of the dental 
  caries, by means of the DMFT index (decayed, missing and filled teeth), utilizing 
  the criteria established by the World Health Organization.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objectives, 
  importance of the research and main characteristics of the study were explained 
  by means of correspondence. There was prior contact with the company's management 
  to obtain the authorization needed for performing the research. In addition 
  to this, the workers' informed consent was obtained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The examinations 
  and interviews were held in the company's dental consultation office, under 
  artificial illumination. During the clinical examinations, a visual inspection 
  was made using clinical mirrors and wooden spatulas, and all the biosafety norms 
  were rigorously complied with.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The preparatory 
  stages of the study consisted of intra-examiner standardization, pretesting 
  of the questionnaire and a pilot study on a group of individuals of similar 
  age to the population studied, who were living in a rural family housing project. 
  During the data collection, duplicate examinations were performed on 10% of 
  the sample, to verify the intra-examiner diagnostic concordance. This was gauged 
  via the Kappa statistical test, tooth by tooth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Calculations 
  were made of the frequency distribution and the chi-squared (<font face="Symbol">c</font><sup>2</sup>) 
  association was tested to evaluate the relationship between the dependent variable 
  and the independent variables. The odds ratios (OR) and respective confidence 
  intervals (CI) were estimated and, finally, non-conditional multiple regression 
  analysis was performed. The dichotomous (yes/no) dependent variable was the 
  presence of dental pain as the reason for the last visit to a dentist. The independent 
  variables analyzed were age, sex, monthly income in numbers of minimum salaries 
  at the time of performing the study, schooling in years of study, type of dental 
  service utilized, last visit to a dentist, shift pattern, and also the prevalence 
  and severity of dental caries. The independent variables were inserted into 
  the logistic model in an increasing manner, in accordance with their statistical 
  significance (p&lt;0.20). These remained in the model if they continued to be 
  significant (p&lt;0.05) and/or modified the model. The stepwise forward procedure 
  was adopted in the SPSS version 10.0 statistical software. The statistical modeling 
  adopted allowed the independent impact of each variable studied to be evaluated. 
  The variables sex, age and shift pattern were utilized as controls, independent 
  of the statistical significance presented.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Out of the 
  company's 860 employees, 754 workers (87.7%) were examined and interviewed. 
  Individuals who were off work due to disability, health problems, vacations 
  or traveling on company business (88 cases) and those who refused to answer 
  the questions during the interview (18 cases) were considered to have been lost 
  from the survey. Of those interviewed, 458 (60.7%) were male and 296 (39.3%) 
  were female. The workers' ages ranged from 18 to 58 years, with 201 individuals 
  (26.7%) between 18 and 24 years, 179 (23.7%) between 25 and 29 years, 166 (22.0%) 
  between 30 and 34 years, and 208 (27.6%) between 35 and 58 years of age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout 
  the data collection, the concordance was maintained at satisfactory levels, 
  with a lowest Kappa value of 0.81.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of dental pain as the reason for the last visit to a dentist among the workers 
  studied was 18.7% (CI 95%: 15.9-20.1). The average DMFT index was 20.2 (CI 95%: 
  19.7-20.7), and the M component (missing due to caries) had the greatest magnitude, 
  totaling 54.1%, with an average number of teeth missing of 11.0 (CI 95%: 10.34-11.66). 
  The F component (fillings) formed 42% of the index total, and the average number 
  of filled teeth was 8.5 (CI 95%: 8.09-8.91). The D component (decayed teeth) 
  formed 3.9% of the DMFT index, and the average number of teeth presenting caries 
  was 0.7.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> presents the result from the univariate analysis. The following variables 
  were statistically associated with dental pain as the reason for the last visit 
  to a dentist: schooling of eight years or less (p&lt;0.001); 15 or more teeth 
  attacked by caries (DMFT<u>&gt;</u>15) (p=0.019); four or more teeth missing due 
  to caries (p&lt;0.001); non-utilization of the company's dental service (p=0.018).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The shift 
  pattern, sex and age of the employees did not present any significant association 
  with complaints of dental pain at the last visit to a dentist. These were, however, 
  kept in the model for controlling the final modeling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  from the multiple analysis are presented in <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. Schooling 
  of less than or equal to eight years continued to be associated with complaints 
  of dental pain at the last visit to a dentist, after adjustment for the variables 
  sex, age and shift pattern, and the other variables of the model (OR=1.9; CI 
  95%: 1.1-3.1). The number of teeth missing due to caries remained associated 
  with dental pain as the reason for the last visit to a dentist, independent 
  of the control variables, the schooling, the type of dental service utilized 
  by the individual and the severity of the caries. Individuals with 4 to 15 teeth 
  missing due to caries had a 2.6 times greater chance of presenting dental pain 
  as the reason for the last visit to a dentist (CI 95%: 1.4-4.9), and those with 
  16 to 32 teeth missing had a 2.5 times greater chance of presenting the same 
  situation (CI 95%: 1.1-5.8). Individuals who utilized dental services other 
  than the company's had a 2.8 times greater chance that dental pain was the main 
  reason for visiting a dentist (CI 95%: 1.6-5.1), independent of the other variables 
  studied.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The response 
  rate obtained for dental pain as the reason for the last visit to a dentist 
  was 87.7%, which contributes to the internal validity of the study. Moreover, 
  the losses from the study did not interfere in the results, since these presented 
  a balanced distribution across the different segments of the population studied. 
  Nonetheless, despite actively seeking the missing people during the data collection 
  period, it must be considered possible that the results have underestimated 
  the prevalence of pain at the last visit to a dentist, since the individuals 
  who were more ill may have been absent from work at the time of the examination 
  and interview. On the other hand, the reproducibility of the data was ensured 
  by the process of training and standardization that the research went through, 
  and also by the high concordance obtained through the Kappa test.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The population 
  studied represented 10% of the adult population and one-third of the salaried 
  population of the municipality. These percentages do not guarantee that the 
  results regarding dental pain as the reason for the last visit to the dentist 
  can be generalized for the adult population of the municipality, nor do they 
  for adult populations in other regions of Brazil. Furthermore, it has been considered 
  hypothetically that the results from this working population that was attended 
  by dental services would be better than among the non-working population. No 
  population-based information about dental pain among adults is available. It 
  is considered that it would be difficult to extrapolate these findings to other 
  populations, and even to the remainder of this municipality's population, as 
  pointed out above, since the working population in the present study had a high 
  degree of access to dental services, which is not commonly seen in Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Pain has 
  become a frequent topic for studies nowadays. Among the motives for studying 
  pain are its relationship with new lifestyles, greater individual longevity 
  and the consequent prolongation of survival with affections, and environmental 
  modifications.<sup>14</sup> Dental pain is the most frequent symptom among different 
  types of orofacial pain that have been studied<sup>6</sup> and is a significant 
  determiner for seeking out attendance services.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of dental pain as the reason why the adults in the present study sought out 
  dental services was similar to what was found in a survey performed in Sri Lanka 
  on the demand for dental services at a university hospital (23%).<sup>2</sup> 
  This is also corroborated by the findings on the prevalence of dental pain from 
  studies among industrial workers in Malaysia (18.5%)<sup>5</sup> and Florida 
  (12%).<sup>10</sup> However, a study performed in Lithuania has indicated a 
  higher prevalence rate for dental or oral pain among adults (55%).<sup>9</sup> 
  Methodological variations in the collection of information on the different 
  aspects of orofacial pain, among which dental pain, and the particular way that 
  the definition of pain is put into practice, can be put forward as possible 
  explanations for discrepancies among such prevalence.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
  characteristic that could contribute towards the discrepancies is the high degree 
  of subjectivity in the perception of pain. Cognitive factors such as knowledge, 
  beliefs and expectations, and also cultural factors, have been associated with 
  differences in the perception of pain.<sup>11</sup> In the present study, individuals 
  with a lower level of schooling, and probably a lower level of knowledge, presented 
  a greater chance of consulting a dentist because of dental pain, independent 
  of the other factors studied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The serious 
  cumulative effects of caries over the course of an individual's life and their 
  significant responsibility for dental suffering and mutilation are another point 
  suggested by the present study. This is corroborated by the findings from a 
  study in Finland, in which dental pain was one of the three biggest causes of 
  tooth extraction<sup>3</sup>. In the present study, it was seen that the greater 
  the loss of teeth had been, the greater the chances were that pain was the reason 
  for the last visit to a dentist. Considering that tooth loss was the expression 
  of more than half of the caries attacks, a hypothesis can be considered that 
  the advance of caries causes the pain and the individual's consequent dental 
  mutilation. Caries have historically been dealt with as a problem among children 
  and young people but, as well as tooth loss, they bring in the additional problem 
  of pain. The repercussions of such pain may interfere in individuals' behavior 
  and affect their day-to-day activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  on the severity of dental caries found in this population (DMFT =20.28) corroborate 
  the results from the epidemiological survey performed in Brazil in 1986 for 
  the population aged 35 to 39 years (DMFT =20.9).<sup>7</sup> This indicates 
  that the severity of caries is possibly maintained within the adult population. 
  The absence of an oral healthcare policy directed towards this population, particularly 
  in Brazil, provides a probable justification for the maintenance of high rates 
  of dental caries. Lack of access to attendance and preventive measures possibly 
  increases the complexity of the problem and may lead to two alternative extremes. 
  On the one hand, tooth extraction may be the only technically possible procedure, 
  in view of the severity of the disease. On the other hand, tooth extraction 
  may be indicated to relieve the pain, in view of the impossibility of access 
  to other types of treatment. Considering that the workers studied had guaranteed 
  access to dental services offered by the company, and that 87% of them made 
  use of these, it is possible that the tooth losses found were due to the severity 
  of the caries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, 
  the type of service provided for the individual has a significant bearing on 
  the chance that pain will be the reason for seeking out the dentist. The seeking 
  out of dental services other than the company's tripled the chance that dental 
  pain would be the reason for seeking out a dentist. Easier access to dental 
  services and regular periodical follow-up of oral health conditions within the 
  company's environment may, perhaps, explain this result. Another factor, albeit 
  not measured, is the quality of the services provided, with regard to the continuity 
  of the attendance and follow-up of the patient's health, and also the preventive 
  and conservational services in the company's dental attendance. The offer of 
  non-mutilative procedures in the treatment of advanced dental caries, such as 
  endodontic treatment and the construction of dental prostheses, may contribute 
  towards this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">These individuals' 
  schooling levels, the severity of their dental caries, expressed as tooth losses, 
  and the access to their company's own dental services were the factors related 
  to dental pain in the present study. This indicates that, in addition to interfering 
  in the quality of people's lives, pain is also influenced by social conditions 
  and the conditions of access to dental services.</font></p>
