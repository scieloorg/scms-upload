<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To characterize the profile of pharmacists employed as technical supervisors 
  in drugstores and evaluate their knowledge regarding certain aspects of the 
  legislation controlling drugstores and the profession in general.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>Based on 175 drugstores in the city of Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, southeastern 
  Brazil, 100 pharmacists/technical supervisors were randomly selected. Data collection 
  was done by means of in-person interviews, and was guided by a questionnaire 
  evaluating knowledge and attitudes. Data were processed and analyzed using Epi 
  Info and Stata software. Associations were sought between dependent and independent 
  variables using Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Most pharmacists were women (64%), aged 22-29 years (47%), graduated approximately 
  three years prior to data collection, trained to work in the pharmaceutical 
  industry (36%) or in clinical analysis (29%). Pharmacist's knowledge of sanitary 
  legislation was considered as insufficient for 28% of subjects, regular for 
  50%, and good for 22%. Low levels of knowledge were observed regarding the legal 
  requirement for the presence of a pharmacist during the entire drugstore opening 
  hours, pharmacists' attributions, sale of antibiotics, and penicillin administration. 
  It was found that most professionals have difficulties handling the concepts 
  of 'generic' and 'similar' drugs. Low level of knowledge was not associated 
  with any of the independent variables, indicating that this is a generalized 
  phenomenon, i.e., one present among pharmacists of all age groups and both sexes, 
  irrespective of the time since graduation, institution attended, and modality 
  of graduation, among others.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>We conclude that training in the field of drug pharmaceutical care, during 
  undergraduate studies and, especially, during traineeship in pharmacies and 
  drugstores is deficient. It is necessary to divulge information concerning sanitary 
  legislation so that pharmacists may fully exert their profession, without risk 
  of legal threats or hazard to the population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Until the 
  mid Nineteenth Century, pharmacists were single-handedly responsible for the 
  process of drug manufacture. With the industrialization of medicaments, serums, 
  and vaccines, Pharmacy began including, in addition to the compounding of products, 
  the sale of pharmaceutical specialties as well.<sup>2</sup> Pharmacy is slowly 
  changing its major characteristics, a fact which directly affects the profile 
  of the pharmacist. From the category's perspective, the most attractive professional 
  field – not only for financial reasons but also due to the possibility of applying 
  technical knowledge – is now the pharmaceutical industry.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The estrangement 
  of the pharmacist from his original place of work (the drugstore), associated 
  with the technological and functional transformations characterized, according 
  to Santos,<sup>13</sup> a process of 'disprofessionalization', understood as 
  the loss of one's specific qualities, especially in terms of the monopoly of 
  knowledge, public trust, and perspectives of professional autonomy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Current 
  Brazilian sanitary legislation, established in 1973, prescribes that all pharmacies 
  and drugstores may work only under the technical supervision of a pharmacist, 
  at all times. In practice, it is well known that the majority of these places 
  work without the presence of a pharmacist most of the time, usually without 
  any legal consequences.<sup>1,4,14</sup> The withdrawal of the pharmacist from 
  the drugstore has given room for laypeople and commerce workers lacking in technical 
  knowledge to fill the gap created behind the counter, hence stimulating the 
  irrational consumption of drugs and creating hazard for population health. According 
  to Perini,<sup>12</sup> a consequence of the technological evolution was the 
  transformation of the pharmacist's role, which formerly placed these professionals 
  in close contact with physicians and their clients, into an empty activity which 
  transcends into the field of commercial relationships. The pharmacist's former 
  'health house' was transformed into a 'business establishment', an emporium.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pharmaceutical 
  care</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The World 
  Health Organization<sup>11</sup> defines pharmaceutical care as: <i>"The set 
  of attitudes, behaviors, ethical values, knowledge, and responsibilities of 
  the pharmacist during the act of dispensing drugs, aimed at contributing towards 
  the obtainment of the desired therapeutic results and the improvement of the 
  patient's quality of life."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The First 
  National Congress of Pharmaceutical Care and Medication Policies, which took 
  place in 1988, proposed a model for pharmaceutical care based on principles 
  set by the Brazilian <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Unified Healthcare 
  System). The model was defined as a set of multidisciplinary procedures – necessary 
  for the promotion and recovery of health – encompassing drug research, development, 
  and production activities and the planning and management of drug commercialization, 
  prescription, dispensation, and use, with special emphasis to sanitary, social, 
  and economic consequences.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Resolution 
  328 of 22 May 1999, approved by the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) 
  establishes the responsibilities and attributions of pharmacists and drugstore 
  proprietors, 'pharmacist' being defined as <i>"the person responsible for supervision 
  and dispensation, which must possess the necessary scientific skills and formal 
  training for the activity"</i>, and that the proprietor <i>"must predict and 
  provide the resources necessary for running the establishment.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since drugs 
  have lately become predominantly market-oriented products, it has become increasingly 
  difficult for pharmacists to assert themselves through their technical knowledge, 
  further estranging these professionals from their original function: promoting 
  the rational use of medication. As with several other healthcare professionals, 
  pharmacists are inserted into a labor market whose homogeneous rationale is 
  profit at any expense. Labor relationships often impose upon pharmacists the 
  choice between maintaining their positions and violating both sanitary legislation 
  and the profession's code of ethics. As a qualified professional performing 
  an activity under state regulation, pharmacists are answerable not only for 
  their own technical acts, but also for the decisions of other parties imposed 
  upon them in the fields in which they work. Pharmacists are thus subject to 
  ethical, civil, and criminal implication. In addition, Pharmacists are subject 
  also to sanitary legislation and its regulations and, as a consequence of their 
  acts, may suffer severe penalties if professional inability, negligence, and/or 
  omission are proven.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Based on 
  the concepts above, and considering the difficulties faced by pharmacists when 
  attempting to assert their technical knowledge given the commercial scenario 
  into which the medication issue is inserted, the present study is aimed at evaluating 
  the knowledge and attitudes of pharmacists employed as technical supervisors 
  in drugstores concerning their duties, and the legislation of drugstore operation 
  and of the pharmaceutical profession in general.<sup>14</sup> In the present 
  article, only issues related to pharmacists' knowledge of legislation are addressed.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Our sample 
  comprised one hundred pharmacists employed as technical supervisors in drugstores 
  – not including drugstores with drug compounding services or those whose technical 
  supervisors were pharmacy officers – in Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, southeastern 
  Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Dependent 
  variable 'knowledge' included: 1) knowledge of the legal requirement that drugstores 
  have a pharmacist available during all opening hours; 2) knowledge of the pharmacist's 
  duties – some of which are cited in Resolution 328/99-ANVISA – which include: 
  a) evaluating medical prescriptions; b) ensuring adequate conditions for product 
  conservation and dispensing; c) keeping controlled medication records up to 
  date; d) providing initial and continued staff training; and e) providing safe 
  and clear instructions to clients; 3) knowledge of prescription-free medication; 
  4) knowledge of generic or equivalent drugs (based on Statute 9787/99); 5) performance 
  of services permitted in the drugstore, such as administering injectable penicillin, 
  and those not permitted, such as collecting biological materials, fractioning 
  medication, and selling compounded medication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Independent 
  variables are those that may be associated with greater or lesser knowledge 
  of current sanitary legislation and its attribution. These include worker's 
  characteristics – sex, age, time since graduation, institution attended, modality 
  of graduation, time working in drugstores, daily work hours, receiving sales 
  commissions, having another job, earning the category's minimum wage, drugstore 
  ownership, and working in franchise or network drugstore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data collection 
  was performed by means of a questionnaire comprising 68 open or true/false closed 
  questions. The questionnaire also included statements with which subjects were 
  to agree or disagree, aimed at evaluating subjects' attitudes with respect to 
  a given regulation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Subjects 
  were randomly selected based on the sampling of the 175 drugstores distributed 
  throughout 42 neighborhoods in the city of Ribeir&atilde;o Preto. The sample 
  was probabilistic and was stratified proportionally to its geographical distribution 
  in order to be representative of all pharmacists, from those working in small 
  drugstores in the furthermost neighborhoods to those working in large establishments 
  in the central area. Sample selection included only workers registered in the 
  Regional Council of Pharmacy of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo (CRF-SP) as of 
  May 2001. When a selected drugstore employed more than one pharmacist, a single 
  pharmacist was randomly selected. In case of refusal, another drugstore from 
  the same neighborhood was drawn. Interviews were carried out one-on-one by six 
  previously trained (6) interviewers, between 28 May and 28 August 2001, at a 
  place determined by the subject and at a time adequate for both parties. Interviews 
  lasted in average 30 minutes. The study was approved by the Research Ethics 
  Committee of the <i>Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas – Faculdade de Medicina de 
  Ribeir&atilde;o Preto – USP</i>. All subjects participated in the study by their 
  own will and signed an informed consent form, as determined by Ministry of Health 
  resolution 196/96. Subject's identities were preserved, and data were kept anonymous. 
  Data were entered using Epi Info 6.0 software, and analyzed/processed using 
  both Epi Info and Stata 6.0 software. Statistical associations were sought between 
  dependent and independent variables using Pearson's Chi Squared test and Fisher's 
  Exact Test. Association was established at <i>p</i>=0.05.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 144 
  drugstores selected, 13 (9%) were working without a pharmacist. Of the 131 pharmacists 
  met, 18 (13.7%) refused to participate and 13 (10%) were not located after three 
  attempts (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The majority 
  (64%) of the pharmacists working in drugstores were young women, aged between 
  22 and 29 years (47%), graduated from a local private university (44%) roughly 
  three years prior to the interview, and, despite working in a drugstore, had 
  undergone training directed basically towards the industrial (36%) or clinical 
  analysis (29%) fields. The number of daily work hours varied between 2 and 15 
  hours, with a mean 7.1 hours; 28% of subjects reported working 8 hours daily 
  and 46% reported working 6.5 hours. Only 16% reported receiving sales commissions, 
  22% reported having another job, and only 5% admitted to earning less than the 
  category's minimum wage. Concerning the drugstores in which they worked, 19% 
  were employed by the three large networks working in the municipality. Most 
  drugstores (73%) were not owned by the pharmacist interviewed, and only 5% of 
  pharmacies employed substitute pharmacists. Half of the drugstores had prescription-free 
  medication exposed for self-service purchase. In average, drugstores were open 
  12 hours daily and most of them (64%) had at least four other staff members 
  besides the pharmacist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 24 
  questions on which knowledge evaluation was based, 23 were weighted 1, and a 
  single question (duties) was weighted 6. The maximum score obtainable was therefore 
  29 points. However, the score range among interviewed subjects was 8-25, mean 
  15.8, standard deviation 3.39. Levels of knowledge were classified as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Good 
      knowledge: score =19 points;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Medium 
      knowledge: 14-18 points;</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Insufficient 
      knowledge: =13 points.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The level 
  of knowledge of the legislation controlling drugstore operation and of professional 
  regulations was considered as medium for 50% of subjects, insufficient for 28%, 
  and good for only 22%. That is, roughly one in five subjects has a good knowledge 
  of the sanitary legislation controlling her profession.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">No association 
  was found between level of knowledge and variables: age, sex, time since graduation, 
  daily work hours, receiving sales commissions, earning the category's minimum 
  wage, having another job, drugstore ownership, and working in franchise or network 
  drugstore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
  to evaluate knowledge of the pharmacist's duties in the drugstore, an open question 
  and a closed question about the administration of injectable drugs were formulated. 
  Of the subjects interviewed, 99% cited at least one duty, whereas a single subject 
  reported that the pharmacist had no duties in the drugstore. Duties cited included: 
  evaluation of the prescription (31%), orientation on drug usage (81%), storage 
  of controlled medication (65%), registry keeping (55%), keeping controlled medication 
  records in chronological order (24%), maintaining medication storage conditions 
  (35%), and training staff members (25%). More than half of the subjects (55%) 
  mentioned other duties not included among the above. These included controlling 
  medication expiry dates (23%) and administering injectable drugs (15%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
  to verify the common 'myth' among pharmacists concerning the prohibition of 
  administering injectable drugs, the following statement was given, which subjects 
  were to classify as true or false: "the pharmacist is prohibited by law from 
  administering injectable drugs". Of all the subjects interviewed, 23% provided 
  either the wrong or no answer to this question, that is, there is still a significant 
  share of professionals who believe they are legally prohibited from administering 
  injectable drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Forty-seven 
  pharmacists mentioned at least one systemic antibiotic and/or chemotherapeutic 
  as being free for over-the-counter sale. One of the subjects said there were 
  several, but did not mention any names. Another subject mistakenly mentioned 
  an anti-inflammatory, nimesulide, as an example. According to Brazilian drug 
  legislation, no systemic antibiotics may be sold on a prescription-free basis. 
  Therefore, 49% of pharmacists answered this question incorrectly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among antibiotics, 
  amoxycillin was mentioned by 38 pharmacists (45%), followed by cephalexin, mentioned 
  by 14 subjects (16%), and tetracycline, mentioned by 10 subjects (12%) (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). When the question was posed as a true/false statement – "there are no 
  systemic antibiotics for over-the-counter sale" – 23% of subjects gave the incorrect 
  answer and three reported not knowing the answer.</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="tab2"></a></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v38n3/en_20661t2.gif"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The majority 
  of pharmacists (65%) agreed about the existence of a list which defines which 
  drugs are free form over-the-counter sale; 35% were not aware of the existence 
  of such list. For 46% of subjects, the muscular relaxant Dorflex<font face="Symbol">&acirc;</font> 
  (containing and association of orphenadrine, dipyrone, and caffeine) is free 
  for over-the-counter sale, that is, 46% are not aware of the requirement of 
  a prescription for selling this medication</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Answers 
  concerning the definition of the term 'similar drug' were considered correct 
  if approaching the definition established by Statute 9787/99. Only 18 pharmacists 
  were able to correctly define similar drug. Among the answers considered as 
  wrong, 33% defined the concept based solely on similarity of composition or 
  active ingredient. In 26% of the incorrect answers, the term 'ethical' was used 
  as a synonym for 'reference' or 'innovative' drug. 23% of the incorrect answers 
  contained different conceptual errors, such as "competitor of the original", 
  "identical to the brand name", and "similar to the ethical medication".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Only 29 
  pharmacists were able to correctly define the term 'generic drug'. Among the 
  answers considered as incorrect, 24% used the term 'ethical' as a synonym for 
  'reference' or 'innovative' drug. Many subjects also used the definition based 
  only on similarity of composition and active ingredient, which was considered 
  as incorrect. Incorrect answers also included different conceptual errors, such 
  as "same drug, without marketing", "contains the same active ingredient; cheaper", 
  and "contains the same active ingredient without associations".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When questioned 
  about the possibility of substituting a brand name product only with a generic 
  drug, 78% of the pharmacists interviewed considered this statement as true, 
  which is the correct answer. When questioned about the possibility of substituting 
  a product with a similar drug, 70% of subjects considered this statement as 
  false, that is, 30% of subjects considered it to be possible to replace a brand 
  name drug with a similar drug, which is against generic drug sales regulations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Collection 
  of biological material</i>: 94% of subjects considered as false the statement 
  "the drugstore is allowed to perform biological material collection services", 
  which is the correct answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Fractioning 
  of pharmaceutical specialties</i>: 68% subjects knew the correct definition 
  of 'fractioning', and 79% knew that is the fractioning of pharmaceutical specialties 
  is not allowed in the drugstore.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Sale 
  of compounded drugs</i>: 75% of subjects knew that the sale of compounded drugs 
  is not allowed in drugstores.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Administration 
  of injectable penicillin</i>: 85% of subjects considered as true the statement 
  "the administration of injectable penicillin in a drugstore is prohibited", 
  and 3% did not know. This means that only 12% of the pharmacists interviewed 
  knew that such administration is allowed by law.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Ribeir&atilde;o 
  Preto cannot be characterized as an industrial municipality. There are 1,065 
  industrial plants in the municipality,<sup>12</sup> most of which are of small 
  size. Of these, only six are pharmaceutical plants, which indicates the lack 
  of a labor market for the pharmacists trained for work in the industrial field. 
  These professionals seem to have 'drifted' towards drugstores and pharmacies. 
  Notwithstanding, the municipality currently has four different undergraduate 
  Pharmacy schools.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">We found 
  only 22% of pharmacists with a good level of knowledge of sanitary legislation. 
  We found a low level of knowledge concerning the legal requirement of the presence 
  of a pharmacist in the drugstore during opening hours, the pharmacist's duties, 
  antibiotic sales regulations, and the administration of injectable penicillin. 
  Furthermore, most pharmacists interviewed had difficulty handling the concepts 
  of 'similar' and 'generic' drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This low 
  level of knowledge was not associated with any of the independent variables, 
  which suggests that it is a general phenomenon, i.e., one that is observable 
  among pharmacists regardless of age, sex, time since graduation, institution 
  attended, modality of graduation, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Answers 
  were discrepant in terms of the legal requirement of the presence of a pharmacist 
  in the drugstore, both when the issue was formulated as an open question and, 
  later, as a statement. In the open question, only 16% gave the correct answer, 
  whereas 69% stated that drugstores are required by law to provide a pharmacist 
  for at least 50% of opening time. 41% of subjects answered correctly to the 
  statement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, 
  CRF-SP established, as an internal regulation, that, in order for a drugstore 
  to be registered it must present a statement of opening hours and of the presence 
  of a pharmacist for at least half this period. After four years, this which 
  was an administrative policy of a controlling agency was assimilated by pharmacists 
  as a 'law'. This is a mistake, for, in the juridical hierarchy, category decisions 
  cannot overrule governmental statutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Over 50% 
  of the pharmacists in our sample believed the regulation that prevents pharmacists 
  from being technical supervisors for more than one drugstore to be a restriction 
  imposed by CRF-SP rather than a regulation determined by sanitary legislation. 
  Such confusion may be due to the fact that, until not long ago, in a number 
  of Brazilian states, state Councils of Pharmacy were granting double and sometimes 
  even triple supervising positions, which is against sanitary legislation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Costa<sup>5</sup> 
  argues that, in the field of Sanitary Surveillance, responsibility is an ubiquitous 
  concept throughout the many 'links' of a chain, in which not only private entities 
  (producers/service providers, technical supervisors, suppliers, sales representatives) 
  are responsible for the quality of products and services offered to the population, 
  as well as for any eventual health damage caused by them, but so it the State, 
  through the enforcement of specific health protection laws. In the practice 
  of Sanitary Surveillance, the concept of responsibility in the provision of 
  healthcare service and in the production, distribution, and sale of health-related 
  products is formalized in the person of the technical supervisor, which is a 
  legal requirement and a condition for performing such activities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning 
  the pharmacist's duties, only one-third of subjects spontaneously mentioned 
  the evaluation of medical prescriptions. The duties most cited were those related 
  to the storage (65%) and registry (55%) of controlled drugs. Only 35% of pharmacists 
  mentioned ensuring adequate conditions for medication storage, and only 25% 
  mentioned staff training. Controlling medication expiry dates was mentioned 
  by 23 subjects. A great deal of discrepancy was observed when these data were 
  compared with the list of sanitary legislation infractions verified in the lawsuits 
  filed by the local Sanitary Surveillance (SS) agency (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>). Infractions related to the irregular sale of controlled medication prevail 
  in this list (39%), whereas approximately 10% of infractions were related to 
  the exposure/storage of expired products. In other words, the regulations most 
  frequently infringed according to the local SS are exactly those most widely 
  known.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The use 
  of antibiotics without a medical prescription is a public health problem, for 
  the irrational use of this type of drug is promoting the emergence of multiple-antimicrobial-resistant 
  strains of bacteria. The correlation between the increase of bacterial resistance 
  and the patterns of antibiotic consumption has attracted the attention of several 
  medical institutions and periodicals. This issue was the subject of 45 articles 
  published in journals from different countries between 1984 and 1990.<sup>3</sup> 
  In 1995, Barros<sup>1</sup> verified that antibiotics were among the three drug 
  groups most 'prescribed' by drugstore clerks in Recife, northeastern Brazil. 
  Gir,<sup>9</sup> in an evaluation of the behavior of drugstore clerks in response 
  to a costumer with complaints typical of gonorrhea, found that, in roughly 70% 
  of cases, the clerk indicated drugs, especially penicillins, to the costumer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The discrepancy 
  observed between the two questions dealing with antibiotic sales suggests that 
  pharmacists are aware of the inexistence of antibiotics free for over-the-counter 
  sale. Nevertheless, the retail sale of antibiotics without medical prescription 
  is part of the daily routine of drugstores, being incorporated by pharmacists 
  as a normal procedure. In other words, "it's a law but it doesn't stand". Although 
  the free sale (without a practitioner's prescription) of antibiotics is prohibited, 
  these drugs are sold as if it were legal. Such practice is not supervised by 
  control organs, and establishments that indulge in it are not held liable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This indicates 
  a predominance of juridical instruments in sanitary control measures, which 
  reinforces the role of Sanitary Surveillance as a bureaucratic/registry organ. 
  Without questioning the efficacy of this system, there is o need for advancement 
  in sanitary instruments in order to enforce such regulations. In Brazil, a country 
  governed by the Rule of Law,<sup>7</sup> in which all administrative activity 
  is controlled by legislation, there is an abundance of regulations concerned 
  with the consumption of health-related products, especially in relation to production. 
  Nonetheless, when observing certain practices of medication retailers, we verify 
  that sanitary legislation has showed little advance in the field of commercialization. 
  As an example, Costa<sup>6</sup> argues that it is not enough for the production 
  of a given drug to be authorized, for the industry to have a technical supervisor, 
  and for the technical requirements for production facilities and processes be 
  fulfilled; it is also necessary to expand sanitary regulations in order to control 
  other aspects of quality, such as efficacy, safety, and the occurrence and intensity 
  of side effects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most subjects 
  showed a good level of understanding concerning the collection of biological 
  materials, fractioning of pharmaceutical specialties, and sale of compounded 
  drugs. We verified, however, that 85% of pharmacists believe the administration 
  of penicillin in drugstores and pharmacies to be prohibited. The population 
  that frequently requires injectable penicillin does not have access to this 
  type of medication in private services. In 1995, the S&atilde;o Paulo State 
  Center for Sanitary Surveillance (CVS-SP) issued a regulation (Regulation CVS-DITEP 
  02/95) prohibiting S&atilde;o Paulo State drugstores and pharmacies from performing 
  penicillin sensitivity tests. We thus observe a great deal of confusion amongst 
  pharmacists, who understood that, in addition to the test, the administration 
  of penicillin itself was prohibited, and that only healthcare facilities and 
  hospitals were allowed to perform this service. This Regulation was revoked 
  in May 2000 by Regulation CVS – 5/00, which was much more detailed than its 
  predecessor, and which maintained the prohibition of penicillin sensitivity 
  testing in drugstores. Benzathine penicillin is the main resource available 
  for reducing the levels of morbi-mortality associated with rheumatic carditis; 
  it is also the treatment of choice for treating streptococcal pharyngitis and 
  the most efficacious drug in treating syphilis, in addition to being very affordable. 
  A study<sup>7</sup> carried out with 300 healthcare professionals including 
  physicians, pharmacists, and nurses demonstrated that Regulation CVS 02/95 had 
  a strong negative impact on the prescription and administration of benzathine 
  penicillin outside the emergency-room/hospital environment, where the majority 
  of professionals also believe the administration of benzathine penicillin to 
  be prohibited in drugstores and pharmacies, showing a lack of knowledge of usage 
  and/or sensitivity testing regulations. There is, therefore, a clear need for 
  discussing this subject with all professionals involved, clarifying the contents 
  of the aforementioned regulation, as well as the risks and benefits of the use 
  of penicillin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning 
  the definitions of generic and similar drugs, we found that the term 'ethical 
  drug' was frequently employed as a synonym for innovative or reference drug. 
  This is a non-technical term, incorporated into the professional jargon due 
  to pharmaceutical industry marketing, following a market-oriented logic promoted 
  by the large pharmaceutical laboratories who own the rights for developing these 
  drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">We observed 
  a large amount of confusion among pharmacists concerning the term 'similar drug', 
  with only 18% of subjects being able to correctly define the term, whereas the 
  definition of generic drug was chosen by 29% of subjects. Such confusion may 
  be due to the recently issued legislation controlling the production and sale 
  of generic drugs, established by Statute 9,787, of 10 February 2000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
  we found that approximately 70% of subjects knew about the interchangeability 
  between generic and brand name drugs, i.e., know that a prescribed drug may 
  be replaced exclusively by the corresponding generic drug. Since the Generic 
  Drug Statute was issued, pharmacists have been provided, by both control organs 
  and phramaceutical associations with divulgation and clarification material 
  containing technical information on the subject, which have greatly contributed 
  towards the involvement of these professionals in the generic drug issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Statute 
  allowing the sale of generic drugs has been an important instrument for nationwide 
  medication policies. Sanitary Surveillance is a function strictly governmental 
  in character, intended to harmonize economic and social interests for the protection 
  of individual and collective health. Hence, it is its job to promote measures 
  which stimulate the adoption and use of generic drugs, providing means to ensure 
  widespread communication, information, and education concerning these drugs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study was aimed at proving the hypothesis that training in the field of drug-related 
  pharmacological care is deficient at both the undergraduate level and, especially, 
  during traineeship in pharmacies or drugstores.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to our results, which show that knowledge was not associated with any independent 
  variable – thus suggesting a generalized phenomenon, i.e., one present among 
  pharmacists of several age groups, both sexes, regardless of time since graduation, 
  school attended, modality of graduation, etc. –, it is likely that Pharmacy 
  schools do not provide the basic theoretical and practical knowledge that would 
  allow future pharmacists to act in drug dispensation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Pharmacists 
  that work in drugstores receive training directed towards the practice of pharmaceutical 
  care, most of them being trained for the fields of industrial production and 
  clinical analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, 
  we identified the need for training based on knowledge of drugs and sanitary 
  legislation, so that pharmacists are able, in the future, to fully exert their 
  profession without the threat of legal prosecution or hazard to the population. 
  Training (and retraining in the work environment) in the field of drug dispensation, 
  along with direct supervision and continued education should also be part of 
  the policy proposals forwarded by pharmacist unions and associations, with the 
  effective participation of the educational institutions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  perspective of Sanitary Law, sanitary education and legislation are especially 
  important for the effectiveness of sanitary surveillance actions, healthcare 
  professionals being the major social actors in the protection of public health 
  and quality of life.</font></p>
