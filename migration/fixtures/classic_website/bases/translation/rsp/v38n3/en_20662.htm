<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>To translate into and validate for Portuguese the "International Consultation 
  on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form" (ICIQ-SF), a condition-specific 
  quality-of-life questionnaire for patients with urinary incontinence.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>Two Brazilians independently translated the original ICIQ-SF 
  into Portuguese. These two translations were harmonized, and then checked by 
  independent back-translation by two native English speakers. The harmonized 
  translation was pre-tested in a pilot study on 20 patients. The final version 
  of the ICIQ-SF in Portuguese was applied to 123 consecutive patients aged 16 
  or over (29 males and 94 females) with a complaint of urinary incontinence, 
  who had sought the Department of Urogynecology and Uroneurology of the School 
  of Medical Sciences of Unicamp. The Portuguese version of the King's Health 
  Questionnaire (KHQ) was also applied to the same group. The psychometric properties 
  of the questionnaire, such as reliability and construct validity were assessed.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>The median age was 53 years (range: 16 to 86). The mean retest 
  interval for the ICIQ-SF was 14.37 days (range: 6 to 41). No changes from the 
  original format of the ICIQ-SF were observed at the end of the process of translation 
  and cultural adaptation. The internal consistency was high (0.88), as measured 
  by the Cronbach alpha coefficient. The test-retest value was considered moderate 
  to strong, as measured by the weighted Kappa index (range: 0.72 to 0.75) and 
  Pearson correlation coefficient (0.89). The correlation between the ICIQ-SF 
  and KHQ was considered to be moderate to good for most items (range: 0.44 to 
  0.77). The evaluation of the construct and concurrent validity was also satisfactory 
  and statistically significant.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The "International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire" 
  (ICIQ-SF) was successfully translated into Portuguese and validated for application 
  to Brazilian female and male patients complaining of urinary incontinence, with 
  satisfactory reliability and construct validity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The use 
  of generic or specific questionnaires as instruments for evaluating the quality 
  of life has intensified in scientific research over recent years. This is due 
  to the fact that there is growing interest in subjective clinical evaluation 
  methods among health researchers. Patients' opinions on their state of health 
  are thus given value. Over the last decade, various questionnaires in the field 
  of urinary dysfunctions have been constructed. These instruments, generally 
  compiled in the English language, evaluate the impact of such dysfunctions on 
  patients' quality of life. Because of their length, such questionnaires become 
  inefficient and consequently difficult to apply in clinical practice, or even 
  in scientific research.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
  use of questionnaires in other languages and cultures to be appropriate, they 
  need to be submitted to the international translation and cultural adaptation 
  rules for the target language.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Urinary 
  incontinence is not a disease, but rather a symptom and sign of vesical dysfunction 
  and/or urethral sphincter mechanism dysfunction.<sup>12</sup> The standardization 
  committee of the International Continence Society (ICS) considers urinary incontinence 
  to be "a complaint of any involuntary loss of urine".<sup>1</sup> This committee 
  recommended in 1997 that quality-of-life measurements should be included in 
  all clinical research on urinary incontinence, as a complementary addition to 
  the traditional clinical parameters.<sup>4</sup> There is a consensus in the 
  international literature that urinary incontinence may adversely affect quality 
  of life, with significant implications in many spheres, such as the psychological, 
  social, physical, economic, personal relational and sexual domains.<sup>6</sup> 
  It is presented not only as a threat to self-esteem, but also as a factor in 
  social isolation and depression. Another consensus among quality-of-life researchers 
  in the field of urinary dysfunctions is that patients themselves are the best 
  judges in evaluating quality of life.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">King's Health 
  Questionnaire (KHQ)<sup>11</sup> is an instrument for evaluating the impact 
  of lower urinary tract symptoms on women's quality of life. It was recently 
  submitted to the process of translation and cultural adaptation to Portuguese 
  and is now available for use in clinical research in Brazil.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The "International 
  Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form" (ICIQ-SF) is a simple 
  and brief questionnaire that can be self-administered, and which was originally 
  developed and validated in the English language by Avery et al.<sup>3</sup> 
  It was chosen for translation and adaptation to Brazilian culture because it 
  provides a rapid evaluation of the impact of urinary incontinence on quality 
  of life, and classifies urinary losses experienced by patients of both sexes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of the present study was therefore the translation of the ICIQ-SF into Portuguese, 
  with cultural adaptation and validation for use in clinical research in Brazil.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional 
  observational study was made on 123 consecutive patients of both genders who 
  sought the urogynecology and urodynamics outpatient services of the School of 
  Medical Sciences of Unicamp between September and December 2002. Patients were 
  considered to be incontinent and were included in this study if they declared 
  that they had been experiencing at least one episode of urinary loss per week 
  over the preceding three months. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant 
  or breast-feeding women, or if they were under 16 years old. The patients included 
  signed a statement of free and informed consent, and the study was approved 
  by the Medical Ethics Committee of Unicamp, under the number 349/2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At the first 
  interview with the patients, sociodemographic data were collected such as age, 
  color (white, black or brown), schooling (none completed, elementary completed, 
  high school completed, tertiary level), marital status (single, married, separated, 
  widowed), professional occupation (student, at home, employed, unemployed, retired), 
  family income (1, 2-4, &gt;4 monthly minimum wages). Clinical variables were 
  also collected such as how long they had had the complaint of urinary incontinence 
  (&lt;1 year or <u>&gt;</u>1 year), type of complaint (urge incontinence, stress incontinence 
  or mixed incontinence), pad usage (yes or no) and number of pads (1-2, 3-4 or 
  &gt;4 units/day).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The patients 
  were asked to fill out the Portuguese-language versions of the ICIQ-SF and KHQ. 
  The latter is made up of 21 questions, divided between eight domains, and a 
  separate scale for measurement of the severity of urinary symptoms. It is scored 
  by domain, and there is no general score. Scores can range from 0 to 100 and 
  the higher the score obtained is, the worse the quality of life related to that 
  domain is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The ICIQ-SF 
  is a questionnaire that can be self-administered. It evaluates the impact of 
  urinary incontinence on quality of life and classifies the urinary losses of 
  the patients analyzed. It is made up of four questions that evaluate the frequency, 
  severity and impact of urinary incontinence, plus a set of eight self-diagnosis 
  items related to the causes or situations of urinary incontinence experienced 
  by the patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At the second 
  interview, which was arranged within an average of 15 days after the first interview, 
  the ICIQ-SF was again applied. During this interval, no patient was submitted 
  any clinical or surgical treatment for urinary incontinence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sample 
  size was determined by means of the assumption of a minimum correlation of 0.30 
  between the KHQ domains and the general ICIQ-SF score; and setting an <font face="Symbol">a</font> 
  (error type I) of 5% and a <font face="Symbol">b</font> (error type II) of 0.10. 
  Thus, a minimal sample size of 113 patients was obtained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Translation 
  and cultural adaptation</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The recommendations 
  from Guillemin et al<sup>9</sup> were rigorously followed for establishing cultural 
  equivalence with the original version of the ICIQ-SF in English. Two translations 
  were made by Brazilians who were fluent in the English language and aware of 
  the research objectives. After harmonization, the resultant translation (V1) 
  was back-translated into English by two people who were natives of England, 
  fluent in Portuguese, but unaware of the research objectives. After harmonization 
  of the back-translation (V2) with the original in English, the translation into 
  Portuguese (V1) was considered to be grammatically and semantically equivalent 
  to the original version in English, and ready for submission to a committee 
  of five bilingual judges who all worked in the field of healthcare. After their 
  suggestions had been taken into account, the Portuguese version of the ICIQ-SF 
  (V1) was pretested on a total of 20 patients with urinary incontinence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">After final 
  adjustments to the text of the questionnaire, in accordance with the results 
  from the first pretest (10 patients), in which the majority of the patients 
  did not understand question no. 4, there was a need to make a second pretest 
  (10 patients) to improve the cultural adaptation of this question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Content/face 
  validity</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The only 
  alteration of the translation, in relation to the original text, occurred in 
  question no. 4: <i>"We would like to know how much urine you think leaks. How 
  much urine do you usually leak (whether you wear protection or not)?</i> Its 
  initial translation was: "Gostar&iacute;amos de saber quanta urina voc&ecirc; 
  pensa que perde. Quanta urina voc&ecirc; normalmente perde (se voc&ecirc; usa 
  prote&ccedil;&atilde;o ou n&atilde;o)?". From the translation and back-translation 
  made, the Portuguese version was considered to be grammatically and semantically 
  correct. However, during the pretest phase, we observed comprehension difficulty 
  among the majority of the patients, mainly because this question was made up 
  of two sentences with the same meaning in our culture. The sentence in parentheses 
  did not help in explaining the overall meaning of the question for the majority 
  of the patients. Question 4 was modified as follows: "Gostar&iacute;amos de 
  saber a quantidade de urina que voc&ecirc; pensa que perde. (assinale uma resposta)". 
  With this sentence, in the second pretest, we obtained a comprehension rate 
  of 90%. Consequently, it was considered that the Portuguese translation of the 
  ICIQ-SF had been finalized for application among the sample of 123 patients.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Construct 
  and concurrent validity</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The construct 
  validity was evaluated by comparison of the Portuguese translation of the KHQ 
  (already validated) with the Portuguese translation of the ICIQ-SF. The concurrent 
  validity was evaluated by determining the capacity of the ICIQ-SF to distinguish 
  between different subgroups of patients with different clinical complaints, 
  such as urge, stress and mixed incontinence, all of which had been diagnosed 
  by means of anamnesis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">We evaluated 
  the hypothesis that worsened quality of life would be related to some sociodemographic 
  parameters such as gender, schooling, marital status and family income. We also 
  evaluated whether worsened quality of life would be related to the severity 
  of some clinical parameters such as how long the patient had had the complaint, 
  the type of complaint and pad usage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Reliability</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reliability 
  was analyzed by means of the internal consistency and test-retest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Statistical 
  analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Descriptive 
  analysis was performed by means of the frequencies of the category variables 
  and measurements of the position and dispersion of the continuous variables.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As a measurement 
  of the reliability, the internal consistency of the instruments and the test-retest 
  were evaluated. For the internal consistency, the standardized Cronbach alpha 
  coefficient was applied. For the test-retest analysis of questions 3 and 4, 
  the weighted Kappa coefficient was utilized. For the test-retest evaluation 
  of question 5, the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied. For the test-retest 
  analysis of the ICIQ-SF final score (the sum of the scores for questions 3, 
  4 and 5), the Intraclass correlation coefficient was utilized (ICC).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For comparison 
  of the proportions, the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test was utilized, 
  when necessary. In comparisons of continuous or rankable variables between pairs 
  of independent groups, the Mann-Whitney test was utilized. When there were three 
  or more groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized. The significance level 
  adopted was 5%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The software 
  utilized was SAS (Statistical Analysis System) for Windows, version 8.2 (SAS 
  Institute Inc, 1999-2001, Cary, NC, USA). The statistical analysis was based 
  on guidance in Agresti et al<sup>2</sup> and Fleiss.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews 
  were held with 123 patients with a complaint of urinary incontinence, of whom 
  94 were female patients. The mean age was 53&plusmn;15 years (range: 16 to 86 
  years). Around 96 patients (78.1%) were white. The average interval until the 
  ICIQ-SF retest was 14.37&plusmn;5.16 days (range: 6 to 41 days). Most of the 
  patients were either illiterate (22 or 17.9%) or had only completed elementary 
  school (58 or 47.1%). Most of the patients were married (84 or 68.3%) and active 
  workers (51 or 41.5%) with a family income of greater than or equal to four 
  monthly minimum wages (59 or 48%). Around 103 patients (83.7%) had presented 
  urinary incontinence for more than one year. Urge incontinence was the most 
  frequent complaint, reported by 52 patients (42.3%). Eighty patients (65%) were 
  using pads and, of these, 47 patients (58.7%) were using at least three pads 
  per day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The impact 
  of urinary incontinence on quality of life was generally worse among the women 
  than among the men (p=0.03). It was also worse for the patients with low levels 
  of schooling &#91;illiterate patients and those with only elementary schooling (p=0.0005)&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  of the associations between the scores for the questionnaires analyzed and the 
  variable categories was unable to detect any significant differences in relation 
  to color and marital status, as was already expected. However, the study was 
  able to detect significant differences in the correlations of the variable categories 
  of schooling, gender, family income (p&lt;0.0001), type of complaint (p=0.0176) 
  and pad usage (p&lt;0.0001), with the ICIQ-SF general score.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Significant 
  differences in these variables were also found in relation to most of the KHQ 
  domains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The studies 
  of reliability and validity are presented in <a href="#tab1">Tables 1</a> and

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The lack 
  of quality-of-life assessment instruments translated and validated for Portuguese 
  in the fields of urology and gynecology has, until now, restricted research 
  in these fields in Brazil. Within this area, the KHQ in Portuguese has been 
  proven to be robust, through analysis of its measurement properties.<sup>15</sup> 
  Its construct, however was devised for evaluating urinary dysfunctions in general. 
  The decision to translate and culturally adapt the ICIQ-SF was made because 
  it is an instrument that specifically assesses the impact of urinary incontinence 
  symptoms on patients' lives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  limitations of the study might be in relation to the schooling of the sample 
  population. Although the questionnaire can be self-administered, it had to be 
  read out for 17% of the sample, by the interviewer. This procedure is commonly 
  utilized so that patients with little or no schooling can be included in studies.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The reliability, 
  measured by the internal consistency of the items and evaluated via the standardized 
  Cronbach alpha coefficient, was calculated from the scores of questions 3, 4 
  and 5. This coefficient is utilized for verifying the homogeneity of the items 
  of the instrument, or in other words, its accuracy. As a general rule, the accuracy 
  should not be less than 0.80 if the scale is fully utilized, although values 
  of over 0.60 are already indicative of consistency.<sup>10</sup> The Cronbach 
  alpha was considered to be satisfactory, with a value of 0.88. The test-retest, 
  another method for assessing the reliability, was analyzed separately for each 
  question. The weighted Kappa test was utilized for questions 3, 4 and 6, varying 
  from 0.69 to 0.91; the Pearson correlation coefficient for question 5, giving 
  0.89; and the Intraclass correlation coefficient for the final ICIQ-SF score, 
  giving 0.80.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The construct 
  validity was analyzed by measuring the correlations between the final ICIQ-SF 
  score and the KHQ domains. It was observed that there was generally a moderate 
  association between the two instruments. This would not be expected to be otherwise, 
  because they do not evaluate the same concept but, rather, related concepts. 
  The KHQ is a questionnaire with a greater number of items, and evaluates urinary 
  symptoms in general and the impact they have on different aspects of patients' 
  lives. Even so, we observed significant correlations between the final ICIQ-SF 
  score and all the KHQ domains (p&lt;0.0001). Only in the Personal Relations 
  domain was the correlation less than 0.50. As was expected, the greatest correlation 
  was found with the domain Impact of Incontinence, for which the correlation 
  index was 0.77. Since question 5 of the ICIQ-SF and the Impact of Incontinence 
  question of the KHQ have the same theoretical concept, we would have expected 
  a strong correlation between them. We observed a satisfactory correlation of 
  0.79 (p-value &lt;0.0001). One explanation for this phenomenon would be the 
  fact that the questions have different scales and scoring for the responses, 
  as well as one using the term "urinary incontinence" and the other "bladder 
  problems".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The concurrent 
  validity was assessed by means of the correlation between some sociodemographic 
  and clinical variables and the final ICIQ-SF score.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to the length of time of the complaint, the difference was borderline (p=0.07) 
  between those that had been using pads for a period of less than one year, versus 
  greater than or equal to one year. Mixed urinary incontinence was considered 
  to be the complaint that most negatively interfered with quality of life in 
  this population sample (p&lt;0.0001). This is corroborated by the results from 
  an epidemiological study on urinary incontinence performed in Sweden by Simenova 
  et al.<sup>13</sup> Patients who were using pads also had worse impact on their 
  quality of life than those who did not use such protection (p&lt;0.0001). This 
  result is similar to what was found in the validation of the KHQ for Portuguese.<sup>15</sup> 
  One possible explanation for this finding could be the fact that women with 
  urinary incontinence may adapt their lifestyle so as to avoid situations of 
  physical effort. On the other hand, women who have a predominance of urge incontinence 
  are incapable of exercising control over their urinary function and are subjected 
  to sudden involuntary losses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internal 
  consistency of the ICIQ-SF was satisfactory, with a general index of 0.88 obtained. 
  This shows that the three questions utilized for calculating the internal consistency 
  had a good degree of correlation between each other, and also presented a positive 
  correlation between their items. The internal consistency of the KHQ was 0.93, 
  which was considered to be very satisfactory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In analyzing 
  the general results obtained, we observed that the hypotheses put forward previously 
  were confirmed, since the worst quality of life measured by the ICIQ-SF was 
  related to the greatest severity of clinical and sociodemographic parameters 
  surveyed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">We would 
  propose in the future to study the responsiveness of the ICIQ-SF. This questionnaire 
  forms part of an international project called the "ICIQ Modular Questionnaire", 
  which involves the construction and validation of short and specific questionnaires 
  for hyperactive bladders, fecal incontinence and nocturia, among others.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The ICIQ-SF 
  was successfully translated and validated for Portuguese, according to the result 
  of the final analysis of its measurement properties. Because of its simplicity 
  and brevity, it becomes a practical instrument that is available for utilization 
  in clinical research and epidemiological trials in Brazil.</font></p>
