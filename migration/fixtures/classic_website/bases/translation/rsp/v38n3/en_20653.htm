<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Hospital infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
  elderly population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence 
  of hospital infection and risk factors associated with it.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>This is a prospective study of a sample of 332 elderly people, 60 years 
  and older, interned in a university hospital, between September 1999 and February 
  2000. Sample size was calculated according to the Fisher and Belle formula, 
  with a confidence interval of 0.95%, from a total of 760 elderly patients interned, 
  in proportion to the number of patients present in each in-patient unit, in 
  the 1997. Criteria for defining hospital infection were those established by 
  the Center for Diseases and Prevention Control. Odds ratio and logistic regression 
  were utilized for statistical analysis of the data.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>The rate of hospital infection was 23.6%. The prevalent topographies of 
  infection were respiratory infections (27.6%), urinary tract infections (26.4%) 
  and surgical wound infections (23.6%). The period of hospitalization of patients 
  who did have hospital infections was 6.9 days, while those who had hospital 
  infections were hospitalized for 15.9 days (p&lt;0.05). Mortality rate among 
  hospitalized patients was 9.6% and the rate of lethality among patients with 
  hospital infection was 22.9% (p&lt;0.05). Risk factors found for hospital infection 
  were cholangiography (odds ratio (OR) =46.4, confidence interval 95% (CI95%) 
  =4.4-485); diabetes mellitus (OR=9.9, CI 95% =4.4-22.3); chronic obstructive 
  pulmonary disease (OR=8.3, CI 95% =2.9-23.7); urinary catheters (OR=5, CI 95% 
  =2.7-11.8); hospitalization with community infection (OR=3.9, CI 95% =1.7-8.9) 
  and mechanic ventilation (OR=3.8, CI 95% =1.9-6.3).<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>Hospital infection presented elevated incidence and lethality and it increased 
  the period of hospitalization among the elderly studied.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Studies 
  concerning the occurrence and risk of infectious diseases are important in as 
  much as these are frequent causes of hospitalization and death. Among populations 
  aged sixty and more, infectious processes result in an increased morbidity and 
  mortality, when compared to younger individuals.<sup>14</sup> The World Health 
  Organization suggests that the age limit for studies concerning older adults 
  should be sixty years and older.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian 
  Ministry of Health defined <i>hospital infection</i> as that infection acquired 
  after the patient was admitted to the hospital and which manifested itself during 
  his hospital stay or after he was released form the hospital, and that may be 
  related to his stay at the hospital or to hospital procedures.<sup>6</sup> During 
  his stay, the elderly patient has a greater risk of developing a hospital infection.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The most 
  frequent topographies of hospital infection are infections of the urinary tract, 
  pneumonia, infections of the site of surgery and sepsis, with distribution, 
  expressed in percentages, varying respectively, from 40.8 to 42%, 11 to 32.9%, 
  8 to 24% and 5 to 9.2%.<sup>8,15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Occurrence 
  of hospital infection determines an increase in the length of stay (by 4 days, 
  on the average), in the costs of hospitalization, and in the rates of mortality 
  among the affected population.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The determinants 
  of hospital infection risk may be found among the characteristics and exposures 
  of patients which predispose them to infections. Patients submitted to these 
  risk factors would present higher levels of hospital infection.<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
  few studies which analyze risk factors for hospital infection within this age 
  group, a condition which is particularly important within this group.<sup>2,14,15</sup> 
  In a multicentric French study with 4,252 adult patients, 429 developed hospital 
  infection with a 10.1% prevalence. The presence of co-morbidities, neoplasms, 
  neutropenia, previous use of antimicrobian agents, hospital stay in an intensive 
  care unit, transference to another hospital, tracheal intubation for more than 
  24 hours and prolonged hospital stay were independently associated with hospital 
  infection.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The objective 
  of the present investigation was to study the occurrence of hospital infection 
  in a population of elderly people interned at a university hospital.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Seven hundred 
  and sixty (760) patients, sixty years or older interned in a university hospital 
  located in the municipality of Botucatu, in the state of Sao Paulo, during the 
  period between September 1999 and February 2000, were selected for this study. 
  Among these, 322 were evaluated prospectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The size 
  of the sample was calculated by the Fischer and Belle formula, utilizing a 95% 
  confidence interval with a precision of 3% for the expected prevalence of hospital 
  infection.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The proportion 
  of patients 60 years of age and older with hospital infection at the hospital 
  where this study was conducted, which, in 1997, represented 8.5% of the patients, 
  was taken as a basis for this investigation.</font></p>

  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"> infection 
      acquired after the patient's admission to the hospital and which manifested 
      itself during of after the period in which the patient was hospitalized,

    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">when, 
      at the same topography in which a communitarian infection was diagnosed, 
      a different germ was isolated and the clinical conditions of the patient 
      grew worse;</font></p>

  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">the 
      clinical expression of the infection presented itself 72 hours or more after 
      hospital admission, when the period of incubation of the microorganism was 
      unknown and there was no clinical evidence and/or results of laboratory 
      exams indicating infection when the patient was admitted to the hospital;</font></p>

</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Criteria 
  utilized when defining topographies of hospital infection &#91;HI&#93; were established 
  by the Center for Diseases and Prevention Control (CDC-EUA).<sup>6</sup> Topographies 
  investigated were infection of the site of surgery, of the blood system, of 
  the respiratory tract, of the urinary tract, osteoarticular infection, infection 
  of the cardiovascular system, of the central nervous system, of the gastrointestinal 
  tract, of the reproductive system, of the skin and soft parts, infection in 
  burns, mastitis, systemic infection and infections which weren't clearly identified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Patients 
  were evaluated with respect to the main cause of hospitalization, as indicated 
  in the medical records (and classified according to CID-10), whether the patient 
  was submitted to procedures involving risks the day before and the emergence 
  of hospital infection. This assessment was undertaken during a visit, by the 
  investigator or a trained assistant, to the unit where the patient was interned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Telephone 
  contact with the patient occurred after 30&plusmn;3 days, when the patient was 
  submitted to any surgical procedure. The patient was then asked about the emergence 
  of infection, according to the definition of infection in a surgical site. This 
  search method presents an 81% sensibility.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
  variables were investigated: sex; age (younger or older than 80 years); presence 
  of an associated disease at the time of hospitalization (neoplasia, diabetes 
  mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia); presence of communitarian 
  infection at the time of hospitalization; procedure undertaken before the emergence 
  of hospital infection: vesicle, nasogastric and duodenal catheters, orotracheal 
  and nasotracheal intubation; endoscopies (high digestive, low digestive, laparoscopy, 
  thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, rhinoscopy, laryngoscopy, cystoscopy, 
  ureteroscopy, colposcopy, arthroscopy, retrogressive endoscopic cholangiography, 
  pancreatoscopy); tracheotomy; trichotomy; peripheral venous catheterization, 
  central (intracath, phlebotomy, tenkoff/schille), arterial, umbilical, intracranial 
  for monitoring pressure; peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis; transfusion; radiotherapy; 
  use of corticosteroid; use of an antimicrobial agent for prophylactic purposes 
  or in treatments of communitarian infections; use of anti-acids; use of an antineoplasic; 
  use of immunosuppressors; use of respiratory support (mechanical ventilation); 
  change in the circuit of the respiratory apparatus within an interval greater 
  than 48 hours; punction/ drainage (thorax cal, abscess, liquoric, ascitic fluid, 
  articular); total parenteral nutrition; surgery; type of surgery undertaken 
  (clean, potentially contaminated, contaminated, infected; installation of a 
  prosthesis; installation of an orthesis and installation of a skin graft.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
  to be included in this study, the patient read and signed a term of informed 
  consent which was provided to him/her or to the person responsible for the investigator 
  at the moment of the initial evaluation. The data obtained through the application 
  of the survey and through research in the medical records were initially described 
  in terms of discrete or continuous quantitative variables and transcribed in 
  an instrument developed for collecting data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In order 
  to undertake a preliminary, exploratory analysis, the variables were transformed 
  in binaries and the association with the event hospital infection was tested 
  by the Chi-Square test and by calculating the odds ratio (OR), applied separately 
  to each variable. Only those variables which had a significant effect (p&lt;0,05) 
  for the occurrence of hospital infection were preserved.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Multivariate 
  analysis with logistic regression was undertaken, with the of each variable 
  into the model, one by one, departing from the variable with the largest odds 
  ratio in the univariate analysis to the one with the smallest odds ratio. In 
  the final model, only those variables statistically associated to the event 
  were preserved. The methodology utilized, introducing the variables one by one, 
  made it possible to observe confoundment and interaction.</font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In recent 
  years, the epidemiology of hospital infections has received attention in the 
  medical literature. Populations at risk for acquiring hospital infections have 
  been defined in terms of demographic characteristics (the elderly amongst the 
  latter), medical diagnosis and procedures of increased risk.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The elderly 
  frequently need to be interned in the hospital to care for clinical conditions. 
  However, infections acquired in the hospital environment is very significant 
  in this age group due to its high lethality.<sup>13,14</sup> The elderly individual 
  is more susceptible to acquiring hospital infection due to physiological changes 
  associated to aging, to a decline in the immunological response and to invasive 
  procedures undertaken.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The percentage 
  of patients with hospital infection was 18.6% and the rate of hospital infection 
  among the elderly population studied was 23.6%. Beaujean et al indicated that 
  the population interned in a geriatric ward in Holland presented a 33.3 % rate 
  of patients with hospital infection and the rate of hospital infection was 42%. 
  In a study with adult patients, those with hospital infection represented 17.5% 
  (226/1291).<sup>2</sup> In the first brazilian investigation concerning hospital 
  infections,<sup>10</sup> 8,624 patients were assessed, 2,294 of them were over 
  60 years old. The percentage of patients with hospital infection was 13% and 
  among the elderly patients, it was 11.9%. The geriatric population studied presented 
  lower rates of hospital infection than an investigation undertaken among an 
  elderly population and a higher rate than was found among elderly patients in 
  the Brazilian study on hospital infection.<sup>1,10</sup> Different population 
  profiles should be taken into consideration when discussing the rates of hospital 
  infection; patients submitted to procedures of increased risk and those at age 
  extremities (neonates and the elderly) have increased rates of hospital infection.<sup>8,14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalent 
  topographies of HI in the hospital investigated were respiratory infection (27.6%), 
  urinary infection (26.4%) and infection of the surgical site (23,4%). According 
  to Prade et al,<sup>10</sup> in a multicentric Brazilian study with populations 
  of all age groups, the prevalent topographies were respiratory infection (28.9%), 
  infection of the surgical site (15.6%) and of the skin (15.5%). Zamir et al<sup>15</sup> 
  state that the most frequent topographies of hospital infection were infection 
  of the urinary tract, pneumonia and sepsis with the following rates respectively, 
  40.8%, 32.9% and 9.2%. It may be observed that the population studied presented 
  topographies similar to those indicated in the literature, although the distribution 
  was different.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  study, the mean period of prolonged hospital stay, after the patient acquired 
  hospital infection was 8.2 days. This represents a longer period than that indicated 
  in the Study of Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection (SENIC), which describes an 
  average of four days of prolonged hospital stay,<sup>7</sup> indicating that 
  when the elderly acquire hospital infection they require a longer period of 
  internment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A study 
  with 645 adult patients in a university hospital in England presented a rate 
  of hospital infection of 15%.<sup>5</sup> The following risk factors were described: 
  endotracheal intubation (OR 10.6), urinary catheters (OR 5.6), central venous 
  catheters (OR 3.4), non-elective admission to the hospital (OR 3.4), patients 
  over 65 years old (OR 2.9), white race (OR 2.0), male sex (OR 1.7), surgical 
  procedure performed (OR 1.6). In this study, the risk factors related to the 
  development of HI were cholangiography (OR 46.44), diabetes mellitus (OR 9.9), 
  chronic obstructive lung disease (8.31), urinary catheters (OR 5.71), communitarian 
  infection (OR 3.95) and mechanical ventilation (OR 3,84). The factors observed 
  were similar to those described in the literature, except for the presence of 
  cholangiography. The latter presented an elevated rate of HI per procedure (80%) 
  and, although there were a limited number of cases analyzed (five patients), 
  suggests that further studies of this risk factor for HI should be undertaken. 
  An important data of this study was the observation of clinical conditions (diabetes 
  mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease and communitarian infection) and 
  the absence of the use of central venous catheters and of surgical procedures, 
  described in the literature as risk factors for hospital infection.<sup>2,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Microbiological 
  agents were isolated in 55.2% of the episodes of hospital infection. The frequency 
  with which these agents were identified were: <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> 
  in 35,7% of the episodes, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in 21.5%, <i>Escherichia 
  coli</i> in 14.2% and <i>Staphylococcus coagulase negative</i> in 11.9%. According 
  to data from the <i>National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System</i>, 
  from 1990 to 1994, the pathogens most frequently isolated in hospital infections 
  were: <i>Escherichia coli</i> in 12,3% of the cases, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> 
  in 11.4%, <i>Enterococcus sp</i> in10.9% and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in 
  10.6%.<sup>8</sup> In this study, the isolated agents found were the same as 
  those described in the literature, however the frequency was different. It is 
  interesting to note that the diagnosis of the etiological agent was only diagnosed 
  in 55% of the cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The general 
  rate of mortality of patients assessed was 9.8%. The rate of lethality among 
  patients assessed with HI was 22.3%. Findings of the SENIC Project indicate 
  that 10% of the patients with HI died in the american hospitals.<sup>7</sup> 
  This data indicate how the population which has acquired a hospital infection 
  presents a higher rate of lethality than the population which has not acquired 
  hospital infection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 
  patients included in this study, 60.5% (201) made use of antimicorbial agents 
  during their hospital stay. The reason they did so was for a prophylactic end 
  in 43.8% of the cases, 25.9% utilized these agents in treatments for communitarian 
  infections and 30.3% utilized these agents in treatments for hospital infection. 
  In the first Brazilian investigation on hospital infections,<sup>10</sup> 48% 
  of the patients of all age groups assessed utilized antimicrobials. The total 
  percentage of elderly patients in the hospital studied which used antimicrobial 
  agents is greater than that indicated in the international literature.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Hospital 
  infections among elderly patients in this sample presented increased incidence 
  and rates of lethality and the length of stay in the hospital also increased. 
  The elderly people which presented greater risks of developing HI were the diabetes 
  mellitus carriers, those that had chronic obstructive lung disease and communitarian 
  infections when they were admitted to the hospital as well as the patients submitted 
  to an endoscopic regressive cholangiography, urinary catheters and mechanical 
  ventilation.</font></p>
