<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Evaluate the validity of self-reported weight and height and the body mass 
  index (BMI).<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>A study was made of 3,713 employees of a public university in Rio de Janeiro, 
  in which they were participants in Phase 1 of a longitudinal study. Information 
  was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire, and measurements were 
  carried out after its application. Student's paired t-test, Bland &amp; Altman's 
  graphs and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were utilized to evaluate 
  the differences between the measured and the reported parameters. The sensitivity 
  and specificity of the various BMI categories were estimated.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>There was high agreement between the measured and reported weights (ICC=0.977) 
  and heights (ICC=0.943). The BMI sensitivity, in its various categories, was 
  around 80%, and the specificity was close to 92%. There was a slight and uniform 
  tendency toward self-reported weight underestimation and self-reported height 
  overestimation in both sexes.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>Self-reported and measured weight and height information had good agreement 
  and validity. In similar populations, when few resources are available, it is 
  possible to use self-reported data instead of actual measurements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Self-reported 
  weight and height have been utilized in epidemiological studies mainly with 
  the aims of economizing on resources and simplifying field work.<sup>5</sup> 
  According to the results from some studies, these are valid indicators with 
  acceptable validity levels, even among obese individuals (who might present 
  a greater tendency towards underestimation of weight) and among groups with 
  low levels of schooling.<sup>12,19,21</sup> According to Bolton-Smith et al<sup>3</sup> 
  (2000), self-reported weight and height also appear to adequate for monitoring 
  the prevalence of obesity in the population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, 
  self-reported weight and height present limitations, as do most measurements. 
  Le Marchand et al<sup>11</sup> (1988) and Ramalle-G&oacute;mara et al<sup>15</sup> 
  (1997) emphasized that, despite finding high agreement between self-reported 
  information and direct measurement in their study populations, there is a tendency 
  to underestimate weight values and overestimate height values. Moreover, the 
  prevalence of obesity among populations, as estimated from self-reported weight 
  and height information, may be underestimated, especially among women and elderly 
  individuals.<sup>1,8,16</sup> Thus, the validity of self-reported information 
  may vary according to gender or age, and also according to the socioeconomic 
  conditions of the groups studied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Jeffery<sup>7</sup> (1996), individuals of lower socioeconomic level generally 
  have less access to information on their own weight and, for this reason, their 
  information would be less accurate. Bostr&ouml;m &amp; Diderichsen<sup>4</sup> 
  (1997), in a study performed in Stockholm, observed that, among men of lower 
  socioeconomic level, estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity presented 
  a greater degree of overestimation than among men of higher socioeconomic level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Underestimated 
  weight is generally observed more markedly among women, and overestimated height 
  more markedly among men.<sup>13,20</sup> With regard to age, studies suggest 
  that the more elderly generally present the greatest differences between self-reported 
  and measured values.<sup>8,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to the characteristics of the population, the data collection strategy may also 
  influence the validity of the information on weights and heights. Data collection 
  by means of self-administered questionnaires implies a greater possibility of 
  the occurrence of the "flat slope" syndrome (underestimation of high weight 
  values and overestimation of low weight values) than when the information is 
  collected in the presence of interviewers.<sup>9,10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, 
  the validity of information relating to weight and height has been little studied. 
  Some investigations have suggested that such information has high validity, 
  especially among population groups with high levels of schooling and greater 
  access to healthcare services, with sensitivity values of around 80% and specificity 
  of 97%.<sup>5,18</sup> Even so, in a study by Schmidt et al<sup>18</sup> (1993) 
  performed among the urban population of Porto Alegre, men tended to overestimate 
  their weights and women to underestimate them. On the other hand, in a study 
  by Chor et al<sup>5</sup> (1999) among employees of a state bank in Rio de Janeiro, 
  men with weights of 80 kg or more tended to supply underestimated values. With 
  regard to height, the differences between self-reported and measured values 
  found in that study were insignificant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, because 
  of the scarcity of studies among the Brazilian adult population, the present 
  study had the objective of evaluating the validity of information relating to 
  weight and height and the body mass index (BMI).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Study 
  population</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This was 
  a validity study that formed part of the "Pr&oacute;-sa&uacute;de" study, which 
  is a longitudinal investigation among active employees within the permanent 
  staff of a public university in Rio de Janeiro who were on technical-administrative 
  career paths. The population for this study was selected, during the first data 
  collection phase, from among an overall total of 4,614 employees. Those who 
  had been seconded to other institutions or were on prolonged leaves of absence 
  that were unrelated to health (166 employees) were considered to be ineligible. 
  Thus, there were 4,448 eligible employees, of whom 4,030 (91%) answered the 
  questionnaire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For analysis 
  purposes, four employees were excluded because they were over 70 years old, 
  six because of pregnancy and 307 because some information was missing (any of 
  the measured or self-reported weight or height values). Consequently, the population 
  for the present study consisted of 3,713 employees (92% of those who answered 
  the questionnaire).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Data 
  collection</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The self-reported 
  data were obtained by means of a self-administered questionnaire that had previously 
  been tested in five pretest stages and one pilot study. The data collection 
  was accomplished between August and October 1999. The questionnaire was applied 
  in auditoriums of the university during working hours, and it took an average 
  of around 40 minutes to fill out. The employees participating in the study had 
  assistance from a team trained in the application of the questionnaire and measurement 
  of weights and heights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Measured 
  weights and heights</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">After the 
  filling out of the questionnaire, the employees' weights were measured using 
  portable electronic balances of Kratos-Cas brand, Linea model, with a capacity 
  of up to 150 kg and precision of 50 g. The balance was placed on a flat floor 
  surface and the employee was weighed without shoes, jacket or objects in pockets. 
  The measurement was recorded in kilograms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Heights 
  were measured using a measuring tape of non-elastic material, with a capacity 
  of up to 150 cm and precision of 1 cm. The tape was attached to a wall without 
  a skirting board with the aid of a plumb line, at a height of 50 cm from the 
  floor. Heights were measured with the subject in an erect position with the 
  arms hanging, the feet together and the heels against the wall. A wooden set-square 
  was utilized in the measurement, placed flat against the top of the head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Data 
  analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Before entering 
  the data, a double independent review of all the questionnaires was performed. 
  The data entry was performed in duplicate, independently, using the Epi Info 
  software, version 6.0. The data evaluation was done in two stages: automatic 
  checking for invalid data and analysis of the internal consistency of the responses. 
  The SPSS software, version 11.0, was utilized in the data analysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
  identification of errors and systematic differentiation patterns between the 
  measured and self-reported values, the methodology proposed by Bland &amp; Altman<sup>2</sup> 
  (1986) was proposed. This consists of graphically presenting the differences 
  in the measured and self-reported values in relation to the averages of these 
  values. To obtain a summary measurement of the agreement between the two sources 
  of information (measured and self-reported), the intraclass correlation coefficient 
  (ICC) was utilized. This estimates the proportion of the total variability observed 
  that is attributable to variability between the individuals. In the comparison 
  between the averages for measurements and self-reporting of weights and heights, 
  and for the BMI, the variables were divided into quartiles, in which the standard 
  was the measured values. The difference between the measured and self-reported 
  values was estimated for each gender, within each quartile, in conformity with 
  the above definition. Thus, the negative differences represented overestimated 
  self-reported values and positive differences represented underestimated self-reported 
  values. Student's paired t test was utilized for testing the differences between 
  the averages (from measurements and self-reporting) of weight and height, and 
  for the BMI, according to quartiles based on the measurements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">To estimate 
  the sensitivity and specificity of the BMI, which was calculated from the self-reported 
  values of body weight and height, the BMI was classified according to the bands 
  suggested by the World Health Organization<sup>22</sup> (WHO, 1998). Thus, in 
  the present study, the following categories were utilized: low or adequate weight 
  (BMI&lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with only 1.5% with BMI&lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); 
  pre-obese or overweight (25.0<u>&lt;</u>BMI<u>&lt;</u>29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) 
  and obese (BMI<u>&gt;</u>30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
  to gender and age, variations in sensitivity and specificity according to markers 
  of socioeconomic conditions were also analyzed. The per capita household income 
  in numbers of minimum salaries was calculated from the midpoint of the self-reported 
  net income category, divided by the number of persons living on this income. 
  The result was divided by the value of the minimum salary (MS) in force at the 
  time of the survey (136 reais) and categorized into quintiles: 1<sup>st</sup> 
  quintile (0-1.83 MS); 2<sup>nd</sup> quintile (1.84-3.22 MS); 3<sup>rd</sup> 
  quintile (3.23-5.06 MS); 4<sup>th</sup> quintile (5.07-6.74 MS); and 5<sup>th</sup> 
  quintile (<u>&gt;</u>6.75 MS). The level of schooling attained was classified 
  as elementary or less, high school, or college and beyond.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The employees' 
  ages ranged from 22 to 70 years. Around 74% of the population was concentrated 
  in the age group from 30 to 49 years, while only 2.4% were between 60 and 70 
  years old. With regard to level of schooling, 40% of the employees had studied 
  at college or beyond, while 23% had attained elementary or less. The household 
  income was greater than 3.2 minimum salaries for 56% of the employees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
  a high agreement between the measured and self-reported weights (ICC=0.977; 
  95% CI: 0.975-0.978). There was greater agreement among the women (ICC=0.975; 
  95% CI: 0.973-0.977) than among the men (ICC=0.969; 95% CI: 0.966-0.972). There 
  was no statistically significant difference between the measured and self-reported 
  values, in relation to the other characteristics studied (age, schooling, income 
  and BMI categories), with the ICC ranging from 0.946 to 0.984. With regard to 
  height, high agreement was also observed between the measured and self-reported 
  values, with an ICC of 0.943 (95% CI: 0.939-0.946). Statistically significant 
  differences were found between the age groups of &lt;30 years (ICC=0.961; 95% 
  CI: 0.953-0.968) and 60 to 70 years (ICC=0.861; 95% CI: 0.794-0.906); between 
  the lowest and the higher two levels of schooling attained: elementary or less 
  (ICC=0.875; 95% CI: 0.857-0.889), high school (ICC=0.954; 95% CI: 0.949-0.958) 
  and college and beyond (ICC=0.972; 95% CI: 0.969-0.975). There was no statistically 
  significant difference between the measured and self-reported values, in relation 
  to the other characteristics studied (gender, income and BMI categories), with 
  the ICC ranging from 0.861 to 0.972.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a> shows that there were only small differences between the measured and 
  self-reported weights, considering that the majority of the points are located 
  close to the horizontal line that represents zero difference. In comparing the 
  concentrations of points above and below the horizontal line, a tendency towards 
  underestimation of the self-reported weight can be observed (greater concentration 
  of points above the horizontal line). No difference in the pattern was identified 
  between men and women, or between employees of lesser or greater average weight. 
  With regard to stature (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), an even smaller distancing 
  of the points from the horizontal line can be observed. The concentration of 
  negative points indicates overestimation of the self-reported height values 
  among men and women. The women presented a slightly greater frequency of more 
  highly overestimated values than did the men.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> presents the differences between the averages from measurement and self-reporting 
  of weight and height, and the BMI, according to the measured quartiles for each 
  of these. The estimated averages for self-reported weight were underestimated 
  in all quartiles. This underestimation became progressively greater through 
  the quartiles, reaching 1.6 kg among men and 2.4 kg among women in the 4<sup>th</sup> 
  quartile. In the same way, the proportion of the difference in relation to measured 
  weight also became progressively greater from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> 
  quartile. In this, the difference between the averages for measured and self-report 
  weights reached 2.5% of the average for the measured weight among women, compared 
  with 0.94% in the 1<sup>st</sup> quartile. In comparing the averages from the 
  measured and self-reported heights, there was a small overestimation in the 
  self-reporting among men and women, except among the tallest ones (4<sup>th</sup> 
  quartile). There was underestimation of the BMI calculated from the self-reported 
  values, and a tendency similar to what was seen for the weight was observed: 
  the difference increased from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 4<sup>th</sup> quartile. 
  In percentage terms, the degree of error in the values self-reported by the 
  women was greater than in values from the men for the weight, height and BMI, 
  although this degree or error was small in all cases (between -0.10% and 2.75%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The sensitivity 
  values for the self-reported BMI were generally high (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). The validity of the information diminished with increasing BMI, especially 
  among the men. With regard to the age groups, the lowest value for sensitivity 
  was found among employees over 50 years old who were classified as obese. Considering 
  each BMI category, there were no significant differences according to per capita 
  household income categories. There was also a reduction in sensitivity values 
  when comparing those classified in the "low or adequate weight" category (95.7) 
  with those in the overweight (76.6) and obese (75.2) categories.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> also presents the specificity values according to the BMI categories. 
  The values ranged from 86 to 98% and, in all the subgroups, there was an increase 
  in the specificity with increased BMI. Thus, the rate of false positives was 
  very small among the obese individuals (around 2%). In addition to this general 
  pattern, a diminution of the specificity with increased age was observed among 
  overweight individuals, and an increase in specificity at the highest levels 
  of schooling among the overweight and obese individuals. In the overweight category, 
  a decline in specificity was observed with increased age, which was not observed 
  in the other categories.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The results 
  from the present study indicate that the self-reported information is valid, 
  both for weight and for height.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The graphical 
  comparison between the two sources of data suggests a slight tendency towards 
  underestimation of weight and overestimation of height, among both women and 
  men. This tendency is not accentuated among the individuals of greater weight 
  or lesser height. These results were different to those found in other investigations, 
  in which a tendency towards greater underestimation of weight among individuals 
  of greatest weight and greater overestimation of height among the smallest individuals 
  was shown.<sup>5,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement 
  between the self-reported and measured weight and height was high in our study: 
  ICC=0.977 for weight and ICC=0.943 for height. The average difference between 
  the two sources was 1.09 kg (standard deviation: SD=3.20 kg) for the weight 
  and 0.65 cm (SD=3.10 cm) for the height. Moreover, only 13% of the population 
  presented a difference of greater than or equal to 4 Kg between the self-reporting 
  and measurement. This result is the same as observed by Schmidt et al<sup>18</sup> 
  (1993), and little more than what was found by Jalkanen et al<sup>6</sup> (1987) 
  in Finland (11%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The tendency 
  towards underestimation of weight was similar for men and women. This result 
  is similar to what was found by Chor et al<sup>5</sup> (1999), and different 
  from other authors, who observed underestimation of weight only among women, 
  and overestimation among men.<sup>18,20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">With regard 
  to height, the magnitude of the overestimation was also small (0.65 cm), while 
  it was greater among the women (1.05 cm) than among the men (0.17 cm). This 
  result differs from other studies, which found overestimation of the same magnitude 
  for men and women,<sup>13</sup> or greater overestimation among men.<sup>14,16</sup> 
  It is possible that in our population, with a large proportion of young women 
  in administrative positions, the standards of physical appearance exercise a 
  greater influence among them than among the men.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From the 
  small differences found between the self-reporting and measurement, the effect 
  of the self-reporting on the BMI estimation was insignificant. These results 
  are consistent with those described by other authors.<sup>3,5,18,21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the analysis 
  of the validity of the BMI calculated from the self-reported values of body 
  weight and height, high sensitivity and specificity values were observed. The 
  sensitivity values of around 80% and specificity of close to 92% indicate that 
  most of the employees correctly self-reported their weight and height. For the 
  individuals classified as obese according to the measurement, the specificity 
  values from the self-reporting were around 98%, a figure that is similar to 
  findings from other studies.<sup>3,14,18,19</sup> The sensitivity values were 
  around 75%, similar to values found in the United States (74%)<sup>14</sup> 
  and much higher than values found in Spain (57%)<sup>1</sup> and Sweden (55-61%).<sup>4</sup> 
  Among the individuals classified as obese, the sensitivity estimates were over 
  70% for all the subgroups studied, with the exception of the employees of more 
  than 50 years old (69.5%). The sensitivity and specificity varied markedly when 
  the individuals were classified as obese and were less influenced by the other 
  characteristics studied (gender, age and socioeconomic conditions). Even so, 
  among the BMI categories, no large differences between the measurement and self-reporting 
  were found. Among the women classified as obese, 19.9% underestimated their 
  weight, while among the men this proportion was 21.1%. In the same way, only 
  3% of the women and 8% of the men classified as having low weight overestimated 
  in their self-reporting. These results differ from what was found by Rowland<sup>17</sup> 
  (1990), who reported a greater proportion of obese women (31%) and smaller proportion 
  of obese men (14%) who underestimated in their self-reporting of their weight. 
  This author also found a much higher proportion (18%) of men classified as having 
  low weight who overestimated in their self-reporting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, there are potential sources of error in the high percentages of blank 
  or invalid responses and in the knowledge of the objectives of the study among 
  part of the population. The missing self-reported and measured data in our study 
  together totaled 8%. However, the participants did not know the objective of 
  comparing the self-reported and measured data at the time of filling out the 
  questionnaire. Thus, it is believed that this source of error was unimportant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  limitations of the present study is the impossibility of extrapolating its results 
  to the general population, since it only includes an employed population that 
  was selected for employment by public competition. The study may, however, indicate 
  that self-reported information on weight and height may be of good quality in 
  similar populations (for example, strata of urban workers). In the case of such 
  groups, despite the need for estimates of sensitivity and specificity in sub-samples, 
  the evidence from Brazilian studies has been accumulating indications of high 
  sensitivity and specificity for self-reported information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">From these 
  results, it can be concluded that self-reported information on weight and height 
  presents good agreement and validity when compared with their respective measurements. 
  Thus, as was suggested by Chor et al,<sup>5</sup> it is possible to utilize 
  self-reported weights and heights instead of measured values in similar populations, 
  when economizing on resources is important for accomplishing the study.</font></p>
