<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To detect tuberculosis (TB) disease or infection among contacts of pulmonary 
  TB patients.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>Cross-sectional study in a Primary Healthcare unit in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 
  with 184 child and adolescent contacts of pulmonary TB patients between March 
  1995 and March 1997. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation, chest radiographs, 
  and tuberculin skin tests (TST); sputum smears were performed whenever possible. 
  TB cases found were submitted to treatment and infected patients to chemoprophylaxis. 
  Tuberculin converters, who tested positive for TST eight weeks after an initial 
  negative result, received chemoprophylaxis.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>The sample included 98 boys and 86 girls; age ranged from 0 to 15 years; 
  26.9% were malnourished according to the Gomez criteria. Concerning the source 
  of infection, 170 cases (92.4%) had household contacts, of which 66.5% were 
  the child's parents. BCG vaccination was verified in 98.4% of children, and 
  14.7% of children had been revaccinated. Strong TST reactions were observed 
  in 110/181 children. Seventy-six children (41.3%) were considered as infected 
  by M. tuberculosis and 25 cases (13.6%) of TB were detected, of which seven 
  (28%) were asymptomatic. There was greater occurrence of disease when the contact 
  lived with more than one source of infection (p=0,02).<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>The detection of TB disease and infection was high in the studied population. 
  Contact control must be emphasized, for it allows for the diagnosis of TB in 
  children who are still asymptomatic, in addition to identifying infected subjects 
  who may profit from chemoprophylaxis.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Controlling 
  contacts of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has played an important 
  role in the identification of cases of TB infection and disease, especially 
  among children. Furthermore, it allows for the detection of new sources of infection, 
  thus making it possible to identify patients in initial stages of the disease, 
  when they are still poorly infective and morbidity still is low.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Contacts 
  of TB patients are at high risk of acquiring either active TB or TB infection, 
  depending on factors such as source infectiousness, type of contact, and environmental 
  characteristics. Host-related factors such as age and immunological status also 
  interfere with the probability of the patient becoming infected or ill.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Child TB 
  has its highest incidence among the contacts of bacilliferous adults.<sup>3</sup> 
  The present study was motivated by the increase in the number of TB cases in 
  Rio de Janeiro since the 1990's, which was also observed among children.<sup>1</sup> 
  Its aim was to detect TB infection or disease among the contacts of patients 
  with pulmonary TB. As our study was carried out in a basic healthcare unit in 
  the city of Rio de Janeiro, our results may provide a stimulus for public network 
  healthcare professionals to investigate the contacts of TB patients, especially 
  children.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This is 
  a descriptive, cross-sectional study, with prospective data collection, carried 
  out at a municipal healthcare center (MHC) in Rio de Janeiro. We investigated 
  184 consecutive cases of children and adolescents aged 0-15 years, who were 
  contacts of patients with pulmonary TB, and who visited the healthcare facility 
  through their own will between March 1995 and March 1997. Twelve contacts who 
  did not return to the MHC with the exams requested during the first appointment 
  were excluded. TB diagnosis was ascertained through clinical examination, tuberculin 
  skin tests (TST), chest radiographs, and, whenever possible, sputum smears.<sup>18</sup> 
  A clinical form was filled for each child. TSTs were performed and read at the 
  MHC by trained nurses, as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH). 
  Cutaneous test were considered as positive if = 10mm in individuals not vaccinated 
  with BCG or vaccinated more than two years prior to testing, and if = 15mm in 
  individuals in any stage of vaccination.<sup>5</sup> Children initially non-reactive 
  to tuberculin tests were submitted to further testing after 8-10 weeks in order 
  to verify tuberculin conversion; conversion was defined as an increase greater 
  than 10mm in tuberculin response when the previous test was non-reactive.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Children 
  with BCG scars were considered as vaccinated; the remainder were considered 
  as unvaccinated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Chest radiographs 
  were taken at a Municipal Secretariat of Health partner clinic, diagnoses being 
  made jointly by a radiologist and by the physician who referred the patient. 
  Sputum was collected from patients able to expectorate at the MHC, and smears 
  were performed at the municipal reference laboratory. Smear results were classified 
  according to MoH recommendations. Based on the results of tuberculin testing, 
  chest radiographs, and sputum smears, children were classified as uninfected, 
  infected, and with disease. Uninfected subjects were referred to expectant conduct, 
  infected subjects were evaluated for receiving isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for 
  a six-month period, and subjects with disease were treated according to MoH 
  recommendations.<sup>6</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Data was 
  analyzed using the Hypothesis test for comparison of two proportions. Epi Info 
  v. 6.0 software was used. P-values below 0.05 were considered as significant.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Study population 
  comprised 98 boys and 86 girls. Age ranged from zero to 15 years, as follows: 
  12 (6.5%) &lt; 1 year, 59 (32%) 1-4 years, 68 (37%) 5-9 years, and 45 (24.5%) 
  10-15 years. 47 children (26.9%) were malnourished according to the Gomez classification. 
  The source of infection was internal (household source) in 170 cases (92.4%) 
  – of which 113 (66.5%) were the child's parents and 17 (10%) had contact with 
  more than one relative with TB – and external (non-household) in 14 cases (7.6%). 
  As to sputum smears, 163 index cases (88.6%) were tested positive for direct 
  sputum bacilloscopy, 6 (3.3%) tested negative, and information could not be 
  obtained for 15 cases (8.1%). BCG vaccination was verified in 98.4% of children; 
  27 schoolchildren (14.7%) had been revaccinated. In all vaccinated children 
  the first dose was given at birth. Among revaccinated schoolchildren, the interval 
  between the second dose of BCG and tuberculin testing varied between 3 and 48 
  months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Tuberculin 
  tests were performed on 181 children, of which 110 (59.8%) were strongly reactive 
  and 35.9% (N=66) had tuberculin reactions = 15mm (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a> presents the outcomes of tuberculin tests according to the subject's immunization 
  status. Of the schoolchildren revaccinated with BCG (n=27), 11% (N=3) were non-reactive 
  to tuberculin testing, 7.5% (N=2) were weekly reactive, 44.5% had reactions 
  between 10 and 14mm, and 37% (N=10) had reactions = 15mm. By contrast, it is 
  surprising that 25 out of 55 non-reactors were children under age 4 years, in 
  spite of these children having received BCG vaccination at birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As to the 
  source of infection, 60.6% (N=103) of household contacts were strongly reactive 
  to tuberculin testing. As to the number of sources in the household, 75.6% (N=17) 
  of children with more than one source of infection and 59.5% (N=153) of children 
  with a single source of infection were strong reactors (<a href="#tab3">Table

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Tuberculin 
  conversion was observed in 15 children. 138 contacts (75%) were asymptomatic, 
  and in the remaining 46 (25%) contacts coughing was the most common symptom. 
  Expectant conduct was adopted for 105 subjects (57%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Seventy-six 
  children were considered as infected, of which 54 (29.4%) were submitted to 
  isoniazid (INH) chemoprophylaxis with for six months. Chemoprophylaxis indication 
  was more frequent among underfives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the contacts 
  living with more than one relative with TB, 35.3% had developed the disease, 
  whereas among subjects in contact with a single source of infection, even if 
  this source was the subject's father/mother, 11% had developed TB.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty-five 
  cases of TB-disease were detected (13.6%), of which seven (28%) were asymptomatic 
  and six (24%) had coughing as the single symptom. Coughing, alone or associated 
  with fever or weight loss, was the symptom most frequently reported among subjects 
  with disease. Mediastinal adenomegaly was the most frequent radiological finding 
  (48%). <a href="#tab4">Table 4</a> describes clinical and source-related findings. 
  No statistically significant difference was observed between children under 
  and above age four years, nor between sexes (<a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). A 
  greater frequency of illness was observed among children in contact with more 
  than one household source (p=0.02).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">TB 
  diagnosis was made based on epidemiological, clinical, and radiological data 
  in 14 (56%) of the 25 children with disease. The other 11 cases (44%) were also 
  confirmed by sputum culture. All children with disease had been vaccinated with 
  BCG at birth. No disseminated forms of the disease were observed. Subjects with 
  disease were treated according to MoH recommendations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study – in which 75% of contacts were asymptomatic – identified 25 cases of 
  TB (13.6%) through contact investigation, a high rate when compared to other 
  studies conducted in Brazil. In a study conducted in S&atilde;o Paulo, Morrone 
  and Solha<sup>15</sup> reported a 3.8% TB incidence among contacts aged 0-15 
  years. However, higher rates were observed in other countries. In Canada (0-15-year-old 
  contacts) and South Africa (underfive contacts), 38% and 34% TB occurrence were 
  reported, respectively.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Malnutrition 
  is a risk factor for TB, since malnourished children tend to have weaker immunological 
  response and general defense mechanisms.<sup>9</sup> In the present study, 26.9% 
  of children were malnourished, a prevalence similar to that encountered by Beyers 
  et al.<sup>9</sup> in South Africa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most of 
  the children included in the present study came from low-income families; 92.4% 
  were household contacts and 88.6% of cases were bacilliferous, which indicates 
  a high risk of transmission between contacts. This happened in spite of BCG 
  vaccination having been verified in 98.4% of cases. Several studies have recognized 
  the importance of contact proximity in case of contacts with positive sputum 
  smears.<sup>17</sup> In a study conducted in Texas, Chapman and Dyerly<sup>10</sup> 
  highlight that, in poorer households, crowding and poor living standards favor 
  TB transmission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  sample, father and mother were equally frequent as sources of infection. The 
  importance of household transmission has been described previously in the literature, 
  relating disease severity with the child's age and with the proximity of contact, 
  especially when the source is the mother.<sup>9,12,13,16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">No disseminated 
  forms of TB were observed in the present study; all 25 children with disease 
  had received a dose of BCG vaccine at birth. Despite this high coverage, it 
  must be considered that individuals exposed to bacilliferous patients, even 
  though immunized, are considered as being at high risk of infection, and that 
  recently infected individuals have a greater probability of developing the disease.<sup>23</sup> 
  Beyers et al.<sup>9</sup> reported that 34% of underfive contacts had the disease 
  and 14% were infected, despite 98.7% of them having received BCG vaccination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  sample, tuberculin skin tests were performed on 181 contacts, of which 60.8% 
  were strong reactors and 36.5% of these had reactions = 15mm. Tuberculin reactions 
  may be due to infection by <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, BCG vaccination, and infection 
  by other mycobacteria. It is believed, however, that the possibility of a cross 
  reaction decreases when the diameter of the induration exceeds 10mm.<sup>24</sup> 
  The American Thoracic Society<sup>4</sup> and the American Academy of Pediatrics<sup>2</sup> 
  consider as positive tuberculin reactions those = 5mm in children at high risk 
  of infection, such as those exposed to bacilliferous patients; reactions = 15mm 
  are considered as positive in any individual. Sant'Anna et al<sup>18</sup> consider 
  tuberculin reactions larger than 10mm in individuals unvaccinated with BCG or 
  who received the vaccine more than two years prior to testing as suggestive 
  of TB infection, as are those larger than 15mm, regardless of having received 
  a first dose of BCG. A positive tuberculin test must be interpreted as a marker 
  of infection, even in previously vaccinated individuals. In our sample, 60.8% 
  (N=110) of vaccinated children (181) were strongly reactive to tuberculin. In 
  order to detect TB infection, in addition to the size of the reaction, child 
  age and time since vaccination were also considered.<sup>18</sup> Of the revaccinated 
  children, 44.5% had reactions = 10mm and 37% had reactions = 15mm. Although 
  reactions larger than 15mm are more probably correlated with infection by <i>M. 
  tuberculosis</i>,<sup>21</sup> tuberculin reactivity may be influenced by prior 
  vaccination.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the 
  limitations of the present study was the impossibility of carrying out a more 
  in-depth analysis of the relationship between child age, tuberculin reactivity, 
  and time since BCG vaccination. Arantes and co-workers<sup>8</sup>, in population-based 
  studies with S&atilde;o Paulo schoolchildren, showed that the first dose of 
  BCG, when administered during the first year of life, could interfere with the 
  tuberculin profile in school age, which, from the epidemiological perspective, 
  would hamper the determination of the risk of TB infection. However, in a later 
  study, the same author demonstrated, based on a mathematical model, that BCG 
  vaccination at that stage of life did not affect infection risk calculations, 
  thus qualifying the TST for that purpose.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, since 
  the present study involved only contacts of TB patients, and considering that 
  <i>M. tuberculosis</i> elicits a more potent and long-lasting immunogenic response 
  than BCG vaccination,<sup>7</sup> one can assume that more intense tuberculin 
  reactions are a sign of TB infection, and that the role of BCG has been minimized. 
  Likewise, revaccination with BCG, ongoing in Rio de Janeiro since 1994, is not 
  likely to have interfered with TST results in the present study. Revaccination, 
  which would promptly restore tuberculin allergy in children vaccinated with 
  BCG at birth, but would not interfere in the cutaneous reactivity of TB-infected 
  children,<sup>8,11</sup> had been given only to a small share of children at 
  the time of data collection. We chose, in the present study, not to consider 
  children revaccinated with BCG who were reactive to the test as infected for 
  purposes of chemoprophylaxis eligibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For 56% 
  of the TB cases in our study, diagnosis was made without bacteriological confirmation, 
  since, according to Starke,<sup>22</sup> positive TSTs, abnormal radiographs, 
  and history of contact with adults with TB form the 'triad' responsible for 
  most child TB diagnoses worldwide, due to the low efficacy of, and technical 
  difficulties involved in child TB diagnostics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Mediastinal 
  adenomegaly was the most important radiological finding among contacts in the 
  present study. Of the 25 children with altered chest radiographs, seven (28%) 
  were completely asymptomatic and six (24%) had coughing as their only symptom. 
  These cases would probably not have been detected were it not for contact tracking. 
  The rareness and unspecificity of TB symptoms hinder the diagnosis of pulmonary 
  TB in children.<sup>20</sup> Similarly, L&oacute;pez et al.,<sup>12</sup> in 
  Madrid, report that 38.2% of 149 cases of child TB studied had been diagnosed 
  through history of contact with adults with TB and radiological alterations, 
  despite being asymptomatic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 76 
  children considered as infected in the present study, 54 underwent chemoprophylaxis 
  according to the official recommendations valid at the time. The remaining children 
  – all of which were above age five years and vaccinated with BCG – once the 
  possibility of disease was discarded, were referred to expectant conduct, that 
  is, were advised to return to the healthcare facility for evaluation in case 
  of respiratory symptoms, fever, or weight loss. The indication of preventive 
  therapy for vaccinated children or for children older than five years was due 
  to these children – some of which were also malnourished – being in intimate 
  contact with bacilliferous adults, and to tuberculin conversion. <sup>7,18</sup> 
  The MoH currently recommends preventive therapy for children under age 15 years 
  who are contacts of bacilliferous TB patients, have no sign of active TB, and 
  have not received BCG vaccination but are TST reactive at = 10mm, or who have 
  received BCG but are reactive at = 15mm.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 25 
  cases of TB in the present study, 23 were household contacts, which highlights 
  the importance of contact proximity to the risk of infection. The child's parents 
  were the most frequent source of infection. However, a greater percentage of 
  disease was observed in cases of more than one source of infection in the household 
  in comparison with cases with a single source, even if the latter was one of 
  the child's parents. Among children who were household contacts of more than 
  one person with TB, 35.3% developed the disease. When the source of infection 
  was the child's mother or father, 12.4% of children developed the disease. It 
  has been shown that the probability of infection is proportional to the concentration 
  of bacilli in the environment.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There are 
  numerous difficulties in controlling TB contacts in the Brazilian scenario. 
  Although official norms recommend that all contacts of TB patients be screened, 
  <sup>6</sup> the lack of resources for healthcare, typical of developing countries, 
  in which TB incidence is high, causes a shift in attention to the treatment 
  of the existing cases of the disease. Children fail to be evaluated due to cultural 
  and socioeconomic factors and to failures in healthcare management. Limitations 
  inherent to the healthcare system prevent the early diagnosis of a large number 
  of TB cases, thereby increasing disease transmission. In S&atilde;o Paulo, Arantes 
  et al,<sup>6</sup> report that diagnoses of TB cases among contacts in healthcare 
  facilities represented only a small share (2-3%) of the total cases diagnosed, 
  which suggests that the control among this risk group is almost entirely absent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Contact 
  tracking, despite the feeble resources destined to healthcare in our environment, 
  must be considered as an important preventive measure to be established for 
  TB control purposes. It allows for a diagnosis of the disease in its early stages, 
  or even for TB prevention by hindering the installation of the disease, and 
  may therefore promote the reduction of child TB-related morbidity and mortality.</font></p>
