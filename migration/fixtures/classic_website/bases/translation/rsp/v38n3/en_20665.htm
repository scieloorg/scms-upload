<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Considering that water is an importance source of fluoride intake, and that 
  the consumption of mineral water and prevalence of dental fluorosis have been 
  increasing, the aim of this study was to evaluate the consumption of mineral 
  water and its fluoride concentration.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b>The study was performed in residential districts of the municipality 
  of Bauru, State of S&atilde;o Paulo, by means of stratified sampling via clusters. 
  Each cluster corresponded to one residential block. For randomization purposes, 
  the residential blocks were numbered within the 17 districts established by 
  the city plan. One thousand homes were thus visited. Mineral water samples were 
  collected using previously labeled 50 ml plastic flasks. Fluoride analysis was 
  done using an ion-sensitive electrode (Orion 9609), after buffering using TISAB 
  II. Information on the consumption of mineral water was obtained by means of 
  applying a questionnaire.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b>Around 29.72% of the city's population was consuming mineral 
  water. In the 260 samples analyzed from 29 different brands of water, the fluoride 
  concentration ranged from 0.045 to 1.515 mg/l. For one brand, the label stated 
  that the fluoride concentration was 0.220 mg/l, but analysis revealed a concentration 
  of 1.515 mg/l. Moreover, some brands did not specify the fluoride concentration 
  on the label and, for these, the analysis showed concentrations ranging from 
  0.049 to 0.924 mg/l.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b>The results demonstrated wide variation in fluoride concentrations 
  and reinforce the importance of the control of such waters by the sanitary surveillance 
  agency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The exploitation 
  of mineral water or bottled water in Brazil is regulated by the National Mineral 
  Production Department of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The definition and 
  control of drinkability are under the control of the National Sanitary Surveillance 
  Agency of the Ministry of Health.<sup>4</sup> Because of the need to standardize 
  the utilization of mineral waters that are commercialized by means of bottling, 
  and for other purposes, Decree Law no. 7841, known as the "Mineral Water Code", 
  was published in the Federal Official Gazette (DOU) on August 20<sup>th</sup>, 
  1945. This law remains in force today, with some modifications.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For a long 
  time, it was believed that mineral waters differed in origin from underground 
  water. However, it is now known that they have the same origin, i.e. they are 
  surface waters that penetrate the subsoil, and that their salt content is directly 
  related to heat, since the ability to dissolve minerals and incorporate solutes 
  increases with temperature. Mineral waters are regarded as such when they have 
  reached greater depths, thereby achieving enrichment in salts and acquiring 
  new physicochemical characteristics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Regulation no. 54 of June 15<sup>th</sup>, 2000, mineral water is understood 
  to be any water obtained directly from natural springs or artificially extracted 
  from the subsoil that is characterized by a defined and constant content of 
  mineral salts (ion composition) and by the presence of trace elements and other 
  components. Collection of these waters should be conducted under conditions 
  that ensure the maintenance of the original features found at their wells or 
  springs, which should be kept within the variation limits and have no direct 
  influence from surface waters. In Brazil, most occurrences of mineralized waters 
  are in the form of natural springs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Water fluoridation 
  is a recognized method for preventing dental caries when it is undertaken at 
  the ideal concentration for each region, according to the local mean temperature. 
  However, it is also a risk factor for dental fluorosis when the fluoride (F<sup>-</sup>) 
  concentration is above the recommended levels. The impact of water fluoridation 
  is mainly indirect, through the use of water in food and beverage manufacturing 
  processes and also in food and beverage reconstitution at home (Burt,<sup>6</sup> 
  1992; Winkle et al,<sup>25</sup> 1995; Villena et al,<sup>24</sup> 1996; Buzalaf 
  et al,<sup>7</sup> 2001; Buzalaf et al,<sup>8</sup> 2003).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The production 
  and consumption of mineral water in Brazil has increased by about 20% per year 
  over the last five years, while the increase was 9% worldwide and 10% in the 
  United States. The Brazilian per-capita consumption increased from 15.13 liters 
  per year in 1995 to 23.8 liters in 2001. The southeastern region accounts for 
  the largest production in the country, namely 53%, of which 36.9% is in the 
  State of Sao Paulo. It should be highlighted that the production of the northeastern 
  region has increased by 40% and now accounts for 25.10% of national production.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Considering 
  the variety of the sources of mineral water and the lack of data from Brazil 
  regarding such consumption, it becomes essential to know the fluoride content 
  of the water consumed, so as to be assured of its benefits in the prevention 
  of caries without running the risk of dental fluorosis (Featherstone,<sup>11</sup> 
  1999). Thus, the present study had the aim of evaluating fluoride concentration 
  and mineral water consumption.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The data 
  were collected in residential areas of the city of Bauru, State of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, Brazil, by means of stratified sampling by area, achieved via clusters. 
  Each cluster corresponded to one residential block. The percentage of the population 
  living in each of the 17 districts established by the Bauru city plan was calculated 
  (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>). Within each district, the clusters were numbered 
  and randomly selected until the proportional number of homes in relation to 
  the population of each district was obtained. The sample size was set at 1,000 
  homes, based on a confidence interval of 3% for a confidence level of 95%. Thus, 
  1,000 homes were visited, in which a total of 3,586 people were living (mean 
  of 3.6 inhabitants per home), since the study aimed at evaluating the overall 
  consumption of mineral water in the city and not the percentages of one or other 
  mineral water brand consumed.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The consumption 
  profile for bottled mineral water among the population was evaluated by means 
  of a questionnaire applied in each of these homes. The following were investigated: 
  how many people lived there and what their ages were; whether mineral water 
  was consumed or not; what brand of mineral water was used; how long they had 
  been consuming mineral water; what fluoride concentration was specified on the 
  label; whether some type of water purifier was used; and what awareness there 
  was of the presence of fluoride in the mineral water and its action in caries 
  prevention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
  analysis of the fluoride concentration in the mineral water, the samples were 
  collected in previously labeled 50-ml plastic flasks and frozen at -20ºC 
  until analysis. Sample analysis was carried out at the Biochemistry Laboratory 
  of Bauru Dental School (FOB/USP).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fluoride 
  analysis</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The fluoride 
  (F<sup>-</sup>) concentration of the water samples was analyzed in duplicate 
  using an ion-sensitive electrode (Orion 9609) connected to a potentiometer (Procyon, 
  model 720). A sample size of 1.0 ml was utilized, to which 1.0 ml of TISAB II 
  buffer (Orion) was added. Prior to the analysis, calibration was carried out 
  in triplicate, using standard fluoride solutions of concentrations ranging from 
  0.02 to 1.6 &#181;gF<sup>-</sup>/ml. These were obtained through serial dilution 
  from a standard stock solution containing 100 &#181;gF<sup>-</sup>/ml (Orion). 
  Tests with known fluoride concentrations were performed every hour to check 
  the calibration. The readings in mV from the standards of known fluoride concentrations 
  were entered into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and converted to &#181;gF<sup>-</sup>. 
  The calibration curves were only accepted when the variation was no more than 
  5%. The mean repeatability of the readings, based on the duplicate analyses, 
  was 91.5%. In addition, new analyses were performed on 32% of the sample, thereby 
  revealing a reproducibility of 92.2%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis 
  of the questionnaire</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis 
  of the data obtained via the questionnaire was done by means of descriptive 
  statistics, with the utilization of absolute and relative frequencies that were 
  described in tables and graphs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Although 
  mineral water consumption was reported in 312 homes out of the 1,000 visited, 
  no water was available for sample collection in 26 homes. A further 26 water 
  samples were excluded during the tabulation of the data from the questionnaire 
  because, even though the consumer knew the brand, there was no label on the 
  water receptacle to enable confirmation of the brand and fluoride concentration. 
  Thus, 260 samples were taken into account in preparing the tables and graphs.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Around 29.72% 
  of the population was consuming mineral water, of whom 14% had had this habit 
  for five years or more and 15.6% had acquired it over the last five years (1998 
  to 2003). In the 260 samples analyzed from 29 different brands of mineral water, 
  the fluoride concentration ranged from a minimum of 0.045 to a maximum of 1.515 
  mg/l (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). Among the water samples collected from nine 
  known sources, seven of them (77.8%) presented an average fluoride concentration 
  of between 0.115 and 0.522 mg/l that was greater than what was stipulated in 
  the label. Among the mineral waters from unknown sources, the range was from 
  a minimum of 0.049 mg/l to a maximum of 1.180 mg/l (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). 
  Overall, for the 260 samples analyzed, it was seen that 62.3% of the mineral 
  waters presented fluoride concentrations ranging from 0.045 to 0.100 mg/l (non-fluoridated), 
  24.6% from 0.100 to 0.600 mg/l (under-fluoridated) and just 3.9% from 0.600 
  to 0.800 mg/l. It was further observed that 9.2% of the samples showed fluoride 
  concentrations of 0.800 to 1.515 mg/l (over-fluoridated) (<a href="#fig1">Figure</a>). 
  For ten brands, only one sample of each could be obtained, and these were therefore 
  not included in the tables. For these brands, the fluoride concentrations ranged 
  from 0.045 to 0.778 mg/l.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Increased 
  consumption of mineral water in substitution or addition to the public water 
  supply may have implications for safe fluoride supplementation (Brand&atilde;o 
  et al,<sup>2</sup> 1998; Lindemeyer,<sup>14</sup> 1996; Tate &amp; Chan,<sup>22</sup> 
  1994; Winkle et al,<sup>25</sup> 1995). Similarly, as has been seen for mineral 
  water, the consumption of infant formulae (supplemented milk) has increased 
  greatly over recent years. These formulae are commercially available in three 
  presentations: ready to use, concentrated liquids, or powdered. The latter is 
  the type most frequently found in Brazil. The fluoride concentrations in formulae 
  ready for consumption and concentrated liquids are relatively low and are usually 
  around 0.1 to 0.3 mg/l. However, liquid formulae require the addition of an 
  equal volume of water before consumption. Thus, the final fluoride concentration 
  will be directly related to the water utilized in the dilution. In powdered 
  formulae, the mean F<sup>-</sup> concentration is around 0.69 mg/l for milk-derived 
  products and slightly higher for soybean-derived products. The reconstitution 
  of powdered products requires the addition of an average of 145 g of powder 
  to 880 ml of water. Thus, the final fluoride concentration also depends on the 
  fluoride concentration of the water utilized for dilution, which usually ranges 
  from 0.276 to 0.980 mg/l (Formon et al,<sup>12</sup> 2000; Silva &amp; Reynolds,<sup>20</sup> 
  1996). For children aged more than four months who consume an average of 120 
  ml/kg/day of diluted formula, their fluoride intake is around 0.072 to 0.118 
  mg/kg/day for the concentrated and powdered formulae, respectively. However, 
  it should be borne in mind that children at this age also ingest fluoride from 
  sources other than milk (Formon et al,<sup>12</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Buzalaf 
  et al<sup>7</sup> (2001) evaluated the fluoride concentration of ten brands 
  of powdered milk, prepared according to the manufacturers' instructions using 
  deionized water, the public water supply (0.9 mgF<sup>-</sup>/l) and seven different 
  brands of mineral water. The fluoride concentration ranged from 0.01 to 0.75 
  mg/l in the milks prepared with deionized water, 0.91 to 1.65 mg/l in those 
  prepared with the public water supply and 0.02 to 1.37 mg/l in those prepared 
  with mineral water. Considering that the optimal daily fluoride intake recommended 
  is 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg of body weight (Burt,<sup>6</sup> 1992), some types of 
  milk exceeded the limit when prepared using water from the public water supply, 
  considering the mean daily intake of milk recommended for each child. Since 
  consumption above these levels may cause dental fluorosis, utilization of fluoridated 
  water with fluoride concentrations close to 1.0 mg/l as diluents for powdered 
  milk for infants and young children should be avoided. Non-fluoridated mineral 
  water is recommended for this purpose (Buzalaf et al,<sup>7</sup> 2001).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Milk is 
  the first and main source of nourishment for children during their first months 
  of life, when the front teeth are being formed. Human breast milk has a low 
  fluoride concentration, usually around 0.005 to 0.010 mg/l, because the fluoride 
  transportation from serum to milk is poor (Ekstrand et al,<sup>10</sup> 1984). 
  The fluoride concentration in the milk of other mammals is also low (Dias et 
  al,<sup>9</sup> 2000; Formon et al<sup>12</sup>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, both 
  the type of milk and the water consumed by children should be regarded as important 
  factors in evaluating the risk of fluorosis and prescribing fluoride supplements 
  (Lindemeyer,<sup>14</sup> 1996; Tate &amp; Chan,<sup>22</sup> 1994; Winkle et 
  al,<sup>25</sup> 1995). It can therefore be seen that it is extremely important 
  to evaluate the F<sup>-</sup> concentration of mineral water and its consumption 
  by children (Stannard et al,<sup>21</sup> 1990; Toumba et al,<sup>23</sup> 1994).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Ordinance 
  no. 14 of January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1977, from the Ministry of Health (Resolution 
  25/76) lays down that the label should state the composition of the product 
  per liter as indicated in the respective analysis certificate. Resolution no. 
  54 of June 15<sup>th</sup>, 2000, from the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency 
  establishes the obligation for the label to clearly and precisely state the 
  following information, among other matters:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"Contains 
    fluoride", when the product has more than 1 mg/l of fluoride;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"This 
    product is not suitable for breastfeeding mothers or children aged under seven 
    years" when the product has more than 2 mg/l of fluoride;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"Fluoride 
    above 2 mg/l is not recommended for daily consumption" when the product has 
    more than 2 mg/l of fluoride.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
  according to the mineral water legislation, water is regarded as fluoridated 
  when the fluoride concentration is greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/l, and this 
  should be made clear on the label. However, <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a> shows 
  that the water from Source A indicates that it is "fluoridated mineral water" 
  when in fact its fluoride concentration is only 0.010 mg/l. Analysis of seven 
  samples from this source revealed fluoride concentration ranging from 0.061 
  to 0.083 mg/l, with a mean of 0.071 mg/l. The opposite was found for 33 samples 
  from Source B, which did not describe its fluoride concentration on the label, 
  even though the analysis found concentrations ranging from 0.065 to 0.924 mg/l, 
  with a mean of 0.174 mg/l. This source should therefore be regarded as fluoridated. 
  Water from Source G, which had a considerable consumption rate, considering 
  that 44 samples were obtained, declared a fluoride concentration of 0.220 mg/l 
  on its label, yet the concentration revealed by the analysis ranged from 0.075 
  mg/l to 1.515 mg/l, a maximum that is much greater. The difference between the 
  concentration stated on the label and what was actually found was even larger 
  for water from Source I, which stated a concentration of 0.020 mg/l on the label 
  and in fact ranged from 0.051 to 1.021 mg/l in the analysis of its five samples, 
  with a mean of 0.376 mg/l. Of the nine brands of mineral water of known origin 
  collected (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), seven brands (77.77%) displayed a mean 
  fluoride concentration of 0.115 to 0.522 mg/l that was greater than the level 
  stated on the label. In the same way as in the investigations by Franco &amp; 
  Maltz<sup>13</sup> (1991) and Villena et al<sup>24</sup> (1996), which were 
  also conducted on mineral waters found on the Brazilian market, the present 
  study found high fluoride concentrations (above the recommended level) that 
  were not specified on the labels, and also low concentrations (below the minimum 
  level considered to be fluoridated) for waters that their producers described 
  as fluoridated. This reveals that, even 12 years after the first study and 7 
  years after the second, the problem still persists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a> presents the mineral waters for which the sources were not identified 
  but the brands were. It reveals large differences between the fluoride concentrations 
  stated on the label and what was found in the analyses. The mean values observed 
  in the samples of these ten different brands ranged from 0.045 to 0.871 mg/l. 
  Eighty percent of them were within the minimum and maximum limits, thus being 
  considered as safe fluoridated waters, whereas the remainder had low concentrations 
  of between 0.045 and 0.096 mg/l.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Even though 
  there were large differences between the fluoride concentrations stated on the 
  labels and what was revealed by analysis of the 260 samples of the 29 brands 
  of mineral water, the maximum values of the means, namely 0.871 mg/l, were within 
  the acceptable levels for water for daily consumption (<a href="#tab2">Tables 
  2</a> and <a href="#tab3">3</a>). Of these, five brands (20%) had a mean that 
  was less than the minimum level regarded as fluoridated (&lt;0.1 mg/l). Considering 
  all the samples analyzed (260), it was observed that 62.3% of the brands showed 
  fluoride concentrations ranging from 0.045 to 0.100 mg/l (non-fluoridated), 
  24.6% from 0.100 to 0.600 mg/l (under-fluoridated) and just 3.9% from 0.600 
  to 0.800 mg/l. It was further observed that 9.2% of the samples revealed fluoride 
  concentrations of 0.800 to 1.515 mg/l (over-fluoridated). These results are 
  similar to those found by Winkle et al<sup>25</sup> (1995), who evaluated 78 
  brands of mineral water in Iowa and found fluoride concentrations ranging from 
  0.02 to 1.36 mg/l, of which 83% were from 0.02 to 0.16 mg/l, 7% from 0.34 to 
  0.56 mg/l and 9% over 1 mg/l.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There has 
  been a continuous increase in the consumption of mineral water in Brazil and 
  the world, both for drinking and for preparation of foods, ice cubes and beverages, 
  especially for children. Studies have indicated a concern among populations 
  for seeking water of higher quality, which has been sought through the consumption 
  of mineral water (Ayo-Yusuf et al,<sup>1</sup> 2001; Brand&atilde;o &amp; Valsecki,<sup>2</sup> 
  1998; Stannard et al,<sup>21</sup> 1990; Villena et al,<sup>24</sup> 1996)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
  study found that around 29.7% of the population of Bauru was consuming mineral 
  water: 14% had been using it for five years or more, while 15.6% had started 
  consuming it during the last five years (1998-2003). That is to say, there was 
  an increase in consumption of more than 50% over this period. It was further 
  observed that 82.5% of the population that did not consume mineral water had 
  some type of domestic water purifier. Moreover, 17.5% of the population that 
  consumed mineral water also had water purifiers. Around 47.5% of all the homes 
  made use of some type of water purifier: 7.7% tap-mounted purifiers, 9.8% wall-mounted 
  purifiers and 30% bottle purifiers. These numbers are much higher than those 
  found in Iowa, where 11% of the homes have water purifiers (Winkle et al,<sup>25</sup> 
  1995). However, it is known that activated carbon filters, which are the type 
  most widely employed in Brazil, do not remove fluoride from the water (Buzalaf 
  et al,<sup>8</sup> 2003). With regard to the presence of fluoride in mineral 
  water, around 45% of the population studied was aware of this fact, and 50% 
  knew about its action in caries prevention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">According 
  to Federal Law no. 8080 of September 19<sup>th</sup>, 1990, sanitary surveillance 
  is defined as "a set of actions that can eliminate, reduce or prevent health 
  risks and intervene in sanitary problems that result from the environment, the 
  production and distribution of goods and the provision of healthcare-related 
  services" (Brasil,<sup>5</sup> 1990). According to Narvai<sup>17</sup> (2001), 
  sanitary surveillance is one of the bases of public health and sanitary surveillance 
  actions in the field of public health dentistry should encompass three fields: 
  "dental care services, oral hygiene products, and foods and beverages" (Narvai,<sup>16</sup> 
  1998). The Brazilian sanitary surveillance system was reorganized by means of 
  Law no. 9782 of October 25<sup>th</sup>, 1999, when the National Sanitary Surveillance 
  Agency (ANVISA) was created. Its purpose is "to promote and protect public health 
  by means of sanitary control over the production and commercialization of products 
  and services that are subject to sanitary surveillance, including the environments, 
  processes, supplies and technologies that are related to such products and services" 
  (ANVISA, 2001). Since fluoride is a chemical element that may be present in 
  various products, such as the public water supply, mineral water, beverages, 
  juices, soft drinks, foods, and some drugs and nutritional supplements, the 
  control and maintenance of its proper concentration are of interest to sanitary 
  surveillance (Murray,<sup>15</sup> 1992; Narvai,<sup>17</sup> 2001; OMS,<sup>18</sup> 
  1972; Santoro,<sup>19</sup> 1997).</font></p>
