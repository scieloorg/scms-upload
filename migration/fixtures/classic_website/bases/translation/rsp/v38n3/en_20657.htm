<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE: 
  </b>Lower extremity amputation is an increasing problem among diabetic patients 
  and an important public health problem. The study purpose was to identify factors 
  associated with lower extremity amputation.<br>
   <b>METHODS: 
  </b>A matched case-control study was carried out among diabetic patients. Cases 
  were selected in public health programs of the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. 
  One hundred and seventeen cases of diabetics with lower extremity amputation 
  were compared to 234 controls of diabetics without amputation, matched by sex, 
  age, and duration of disease. Sociodemographic variables, life habits (smoking 
  and alcohol drinking), clinical aspects, and health education in diabetes were 
  included. Univariate analyses and conditional logistic regression method were 
  applied to data.<br>
   <b>RESULTS: 
  </b>Data showed evidence of association for: smoking, last glucose test <u>&gt;</u>200 
  mg/dl, presence of peripheral somatic neuropathy and vibratory perception (tuning 
  fork 128 Hz), and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes treatment and attending 
  nursing appointments for diabetes education were important factors for preventing 
  lower extremity amputation in diabetic patients.<br>
   <b>CONCLUSIONS: 
  </b>The knowledge of determinants and intervening factors for this condition 
  will lead to cost reduction and better quality of care delivered in public health 
  services.</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Diabetes 
  mellitus (DM) is a major public health concern not only in Brazil but also worldwide. 
  The epidemiological impact of diabetes is evidenced by the growing morbidity 
  and mortality rates, and by causing permanent disabilities such as blindness, 
  diabetic retinopathy, end-stage renal failure and lower extremity amputations 
  (LEA) (ADA,<sup>1</sup> 1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, 
  10% of diabetes patients in the United States underwent some kind of amputation 
  (NIH,<sup>12</sup> 1995). Of all LEA, 50% is carried out in diabetics. Studies 
  show that 85% of LEA are preceded by foot ulceration (NIH,<sup>12</sup> 1995; 
  ADA,<sup>2</sup> 1999). Among risk factors in LEA DM patients are: long duration 
  of the disease, prolonged hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, smoking and drinking, 
  neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and prior ulcers (Reiber,<sup>13</sup> 
  1992; LEA,<sup>9</sup> 1995; Adler et al,<sup>4</sup> 1999; Moss et al,<sup>11</sup> 
  1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This study 
  aims at identifying LEA associated factors in DM patients and determining prevention 
  and intervention measures.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A matched 
  case-control study was carried out (Rothman,<sup>15</sup> 1986). Cases were 
  type 2 diabetes patients (DM2) who underwent LEA in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, 
  Brazil, between March 1991 and September 2000. For those patients who underwent 
  more than one amputation, data refer to the first intervention. Controls were 
  DM2 patients who had never undergone LEA. Two controls were selected for each 
  case, totaling 234 and 117 patients, respectively. Exclusion criteria included 
  those patients who were diagnosed DM as of the amputation and those whose medical 
  charts were incomplete.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Confounding 
  factors such as gender, age, and duration of diabetes were considered in the 
  case-control matching. The exploratory variables were:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"> sociodemographic 
      characteristics (place of birth, schooling, skin color, occupation);</font></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">habits 
      (smoking and drinking, current or past, amount and duration); clinical features 
      (high blood pressure and treatment, sort of diabetes treatment, blood glucose 
      levels, patient's self-monitoring, presence and assessment of clinical signs 
      of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy and vasculopathy, chronic lesions 
      in lower extremities, peripheral vascular bypass surgery, infection prior 
      to amputation, osteomyelite, level of amputation); and information on DM 
      health education (DM counseling, frequency of nursing visits, identifying 
      signs and circumstances contributing to the condition onset).</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The det 
  aleta tool was built based on models used in British care services, references 
  and practice. This study also abided by the opinions issued by the Ethics Committee 
  at the study hospitals and the School of Public Health of the University of 
  S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical 
  analysis involved building frequency distribution tables, ascertainment of association 
  between exploratory and confirmatory variables (case and control) using Pearson's 
  chi-square test for qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative 
  variables. Statistical significance was assessed based on the p-value. In the 
  multivariate analysis, odds ratio (OR) was used as a measure of association 
  (Snedecor &amp; Cochran,<sup>16</sup> 1989).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It was adopted 
  the conditional logistic regression model. The analysis was first performed 
  in a full model including variables selected through univariate analysis (p<u>&lt;</u>0.20), 
  which were eliminated one by one (backward elimination) (Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow,<sup>6</sup> 
  1989). Elimination was based on similarity ratio (Rothman,<sup>15</sup> 1986). 
  The database was stored using Epi Info&#174; and statistical analysis was carried 
  out using Stata 6, version 6.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Cases and 
  controls aged on average 66.1 years (SD 13.0) and 65.4 years (SD 12.2), respectively. 
  Of them, 64% were male, 91.5% were Brazilian and the mode of disease duration 
  ranged between 10 and 14 years. Whites were 78% of cases and 71% of controls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The initial 
  modeling process included the following selected variables for gross analysis: 
  schooling, occupation, smoking and drinking, high blood pressure, DM treatment, 
  documented peripheral neuropathy and vasculopathy, chronic lesions, last blood 
  glucose test result, DM counseling, and attending nursing visits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the first 
  multivariate analysis, neuropathy assessment, presence of lesions, and DM counseling 
  were factors that yielded statistically significant differences. It was ascertained 
  that chronic lesions were very commonly seen among cases since OR was infinite. 
  Thus, a new model was created where this variable was excluded because it per 
  se explained the phenomenon, overshadowing a potential influence of remaining 
  variables.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the final 
  model, the new OR values were adjusted to the remaining factors (<a href="#tab1">Table</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Explanatory 
  variables are associated with confirmatory variables in smoking, DM treatment, 
  blood glucose above 200 mg/dl, peripheral neuropathy and vasculopathy, in addition 
  to attending nursing visits.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
  variables have a relation with the etiology of DM2 and its complications. Some 
  variables are described as LEA risk factors and include sociodemographic, environmental 
  and genetic characteristics, lack of access to health services (or inadequacy 
  of health policies, which do not provide treatment equity or education on diabetes), 
  duration of disease, unhealthy habits, and hyperglycemia. Most risk factors 
  are associated to and could be prevented by primary prevention and appropriate 
  health care. However, LEA in DM patients has steadily increased (Spichler et 
  al,<sup>17</sup> 1998; Moss et al,<sup>11</sup> 1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The simultaneous 
  onset of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy – ensuing visual impairment, generalized 
  edema and other complications – interfere with patients' self-monitoring, treatment 
  and foot care, which are essential to preventing the foot-at-risk factor, thus 
  preventing amputation. This indicates that strictly screening these patients 
  is essential since they are more exposed to risk of lower extremity skin ulceration. 
  Therefore, there is a need of implementing diabetes prevention and control programs 
  stressing on education, promoting early diagnosis and care, treatment and special 
  care in treating chronic complications (Gamba,<sup>5</sup> 1998; Rivera,<sup>14</sup> 
  1998; Spichler et al,<sup>17</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There was 
  also found an association between amputation and smoking. Patients who continued 
  to smoke were more susceptible to LEA. The tobacco plays a clear role in the 
  etiology of peripheral vasculopathy and thus the foot-at-risk, a predisposing 
  amputation factor (ADA,<sup>3</sup> 2000). Not much has been done for diabetic 
  patients who smoke or drink in DM prevention, control and treatment programs 
  (DMPCTP). Most often, patients are referred to specialized treatment, which 
  are overwhelmed and are not able to cope with demand, failing to provide adequate 
  health care.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A key risk 
  factor that was not addressed in this study was dyslipidemia. Although it was 
  included in the study protocol, it did not prove feasible because was not found 
  in most charts. Dyslipidemia was only mentioned in control charts, which leads 
  one to believe that relevant DMPCTP aspects are not being assessed appropriately. 
  The same was found concerning exercising, which is also necessary for DM control.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">High blood 
  pressure contributed to the development and progression of chronic DM complications. 
  In DM2 patients, high blood pressure is nearly always seen in a syndrome including 
  glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and coronary 
  disease, which are intervening factors in neuroischemic ulcers and and LEA (ADA,<sup>3</sup> 
  2000). High blood pressure is a major DM risk factor for LEA if untreated. This 
  has been shown in the present study and other studies (Reiber et al,<sup>13</sup> 
  1992; Moss et al,<sup>11</sup> 1999). This variable, however, was not included 
  in the final model. A possible explanation is that when there are other variables, 
  the association between LEA and high blood pressure is not as strong. Nevertheless, 
  high blood pressure is a risk factor among diabetics when compared to the non-diabetic 
  general population (ADA,<sup>3</sup> 2000; Brazilian Ministry of Health,<sup>10</sup> 
  2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">There is 
  a general consensus that about 25% of DM2 cases require insulin for diabetes 
  metabolic control. In Brazil, this proportion is 8%, which possibly suggests 
  poor medical training. Among adult Brazilian DM patients, 40% take oral hypoglycemic 
  drugs, slightly lower than in developed countries. It is estimated that 40% 
  of DM2 patients achieve metabolic control through an appropriate diet and habit 
  change (Brazilian Ministry of Health,<sup>10</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Drug therapy 
  tends to fail when daily care is overlooked. The only factor that can lead to 
  positive self-monitoring practices is DM education, since it improves compliance 
  to treatment and blood glucose control (Lavery et al,<sup>8</sup> 1998; Rivera,<sup>14</sup> 
  1998; UKPDS,<sup>18</sup> 1998; ADA,<sup>3</sup> 2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is key 
  to DM patient care to help them identify early signs and symptoms of chronic 
  complications. Brazilian health providers generally do not perform on a regular 
  basis simple actions such asking patients to take off their shoes for examination. 
  Identifying distal symmetric polyneuropathy and peripheral vasculopathy is recommended 
  worldwide (Weitz et al,<sup>19</sup> 1996)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Reiber et 
  al<sup>13</sup> (1992) estimate that the likelihood of DM patients who do not 
  receive vibratory stimulus to the skin having an amputation is 15.5 times greater 
  compared to those who do. In this study, the variables related to distal symmetric 
  polyneuropathy and peripheral vasculopathy, adjusted to the other variables, 
  were found to be associated to LEA. The clinical assessments when DM patients 
  were admitted to undergo amputation surgery were detailed and showed the preclinical 
  condition. The association between neuropathy and artery insufficiency highlights 
  the need of carefully assessing these signs. However, this is still not a routine 
  practice in DM patient care (Lavery,<sup>8</sup> 1998; Rivera,<sup>14</sup> 
  1998). The Consensus Development on Diabetic Foot Wound Care (ADA,<sup>2</sup> 
  1999) strictly recommends that peripheral sensitive assessment be part of the 
  routine physical examination of diabetics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The best 
  indicator of blood glucose control is glycosylated hemoglobin testing (HbA1c). 
  However, such data were only found in two charts among cases after amputation. 
  On the other hand, a higher proportion was found among controls. It is known 
  that blood glucose control of patients in public care services does not occur 
  on a regular basis because medical visits are scheduled for three months to 
  a year's time. When analyzing blood glucose, there was seen an association only 
  for glucose greater than 200 mg/dl. However, blood glucose mean and median (mean 
  191 mg/dl and median 169 mg/dl) seen in the control group are above the levels 
  recommended by the Brazilian Diabetes Association (Brazilian Ministry of Health,<sup>10</sup> 
  2000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It's worth 
  noting that study protocols of patients with chronic ulcers and LEA should include 
  identifying the precursor event triggering the sequence of events resulting 
  in the condition and exploring future education and care actions to be taken. 
  The results showed that most cases (60%) did not receive appropriate care due 
  to their poor metabolic control, lack of information, treatment non-compliance, 
  and lack of financial resources. These were followed by lack of skin integrity, 
  poor hygiene, foot numbness evidenced by trauma related to inappropriate footwear 
  and other, nail trimming, onychomycosis, ingrown toenail, accidents after removal 
  of plantar callosity by pedicurists or family members, and inadequate treatment 
  of neuroischemic lesions and sudden signs of peripheral ischemia. Therefore 
  overcoming those problems related to adequate, low-cost and low-complexity technology 
  could thus change the progression of LEA and contribute to the prevention of 
  disabilities, which are burdensome and lead to irreversible physical, mental, 
  and social conditions (Rivera,<sup>14</sup> 1998; Moss et al,<sup>11</sup> 1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Chronic 
  neuroischemic lesions, and infections and osteomyelitis that follow contribute 
  greatly to LEA among DM patients. These clinical signs are important predisposing 
  factors to the diabetic foot and deserve special assessment and care (Krasner 
  &amp; Kane,<sup>7</sup> 1997). Therefore, it is necessary to address it focusing 
  on risk management, and using the appropriate care technology and education 
  to optimize wound healing and scar formation processes of chronic ulcers in 
  diabetics. This is precisely when the nursing staff in the public health services 
  plays its most significant role because attending nursing visits is a very important 
  protective factor of diabetes. Nursing visits promote care, education and motivation 
  patients need to be able to actively take part in their treatment, through self-monitoring, 
  thus optimizing compliance to clinical treatment. This is when health educators 
  play their leading actual role (Gamba,<sup>5</sup> 1998).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Health education 
  has a major impact on positive behavior toward habit change and on compliance 
  to clinical treatment. These measures should be the driving forcers in health 
  care programs for diabetics. They should be an essential part of public health 
  services, thus supporting psychotherapeutic techniques, which are key for treating 
  chronic diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Metabolic 
  and infection control, nursing care, feet care and dressing according to modern 
  techniques for treating wounds, and in compliance with disease basics and physiology 
  of wound healing and scar formation, in addition to adapting special orthesis, 
  all effectively affect LEA risk factors (Krasner &amp; Kane,<sup>7</sup> 1997; 
  ADA,<sup>2</sup> 1999).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The study 
  reveals the problems and challenges faced by diabetes health professionals, 
  nurses and educators endeavoring to reduce DM LEA risk factors while seeking 
  to change the current scenario. The methods used and the results obtained in 
  this study have allowed to identify effective measures for DM prevention, control, 
  treatment, and education.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In this 
  regard, determiners and intervening factors for this condition lead to cost 
  reduction and to improvement of the care provided in the public health services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Controlling 
  glucose levels, receiving diabetes treatment and attending nursing visits are 
  important aspects of LEA prevention in DM patients. Thus, health education in 
  DM should be an important part of health care models, especially those regarding 
  nursing. Treating neuroischemic wounds should comply with clinical criteria 
  for risk management and make use of appropriate technology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Health services, 
  addressing health and education, associated to procedures and specialized training 
  can put aside the reductionist view of treatment and open the doors to a new 
  reality, with the perspective of restoring health practices which effectively 
  contribute to the improvement of DM patients' care and life quality.</font></p>
